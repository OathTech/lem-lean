# Gate: no fuel numeral in LemLib or in generated code (fuel-parameter
# arc, 2026-09-04; [USER 2026-09-03] "Any and all magic values that are
# hardcoded and can't be quantified over are definitionally bugs").
#
# Scanned (the code a consumer reasons against):
#   lean-lib/LemLib.lean, lean-lib/LemLib/*.lean (the generated library),
#   lean-lib/LemLibTheorems.lean, and every generated module in this suite
#   (Test_*.lean, *_auxiliary.lean here; P_*.lean under parity/lean-test).
# NOT scanned, by design: test harnesses and pins (lean-lib/LemLibTest.lean,
# lean-test/Test*.lean hand-written files, parity Run_*/main drivers) — a
# test suite may choose its fuel ("Defaults that are chosen eg. in test
# suites are fine", same ruling).
#
# Forbidden shapes (each a hardcoded fuel no context could quantify over):
#   F1  lemDefaultFuel                      the deleted library default
#   F2  instance … : LemFuel                a global instance = a hidden default
#   F3  <worker>_lemFuel <positive numeral> a worker run at a literal fuel
#                                           (`_lemFuel 0` is the exhaustion
#                                           lemma's statement, permitted;
#                                           the numeral must be the WHOLE
#                                           counter argument — `_lemFuel 5`,
#                                           `_lemFuel (5)`: a measured
#                                           wrapper's `_lemFuel (1 + n)` is a
#                                           data measure with an offset,
#                                           certified by its sufficiency

#   F5  ⟨<numeral>⟩                        an anonymous-constructor literal

#                                           pasted into library/generated
#                                           code; `⟨n⟩` with a variable is
#                                           legal) — pre-merge audit M4
# Vacuity guards: the scan must see at least MIN_FILES files and at least
# one fuel worker (`_lemFuel`), or it is not scanning real generated code.
# Plant test (run by hand, quoted in the arc record §8.4/§10 and the
# fuel-measure record): the seven shapes — `spin_lemFuel 5 3`,
# `spin_lemFuel (5) 3` (F3; and `mlen_lemFuel (1 + List.length l)` stays green);
# `instance : LemFuel := ⟨N⟩`, `instance : LemFuel where fuel := 5`,
# `instance : LemFuel := LemFuel.mk k` (F2); `def i : LemFuel := LemFuel.mk 5`
# + attribute [instance] (F4); `lemDefaultFuel` (F1); `@spin ⟨5⟩ 3` (F5) —
# each red, reverted green.
