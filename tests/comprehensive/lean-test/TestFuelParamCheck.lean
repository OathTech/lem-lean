/- Kernel pins for the fuel-parameter scheme (fuel-parameter arc,
   2026-09-04; suite lib root). Every fact here is checked by the kernel
   at build time — `rfl`, `decide`, or a small ∀-fuel theorem — with no
   `native_decide`, no axioms beyond Lean's own. A failing pin fails the
   build. The numerals below are TEST-SUITE choices ([USER 2026-09-03]:
   "Defaults that are chosen eg. in test suites are fine"); none exists
   in LemLib or in the generated code (check_no_fuel_numerals.sh). -/

import Test_contextual_keywords

namespace TestFuelParamCheck

/-! ### (1) the wrapper IS the worker at the ambient, definitionally -/
example : @spin ⟨100⟩ = spin_lemFuel 100 := rfl
example : @climb ⟨7⟩ = climb_lemFuel 7 := rfl
example (n : Nat) : @loud_spin ⟨0⟩ n = fuelExhausted n := rfl

/-! ### (2) the generated exhaustion lemmas (`<worker>_zero`), reused
    A leaf worker takes no instance; a worker that passes the ambient on
    (outer, mping/mpong) does. -/
example (n : Nat) : spin_lemFuel 0 n = 999 := spin_lemFuel_zero n
example (n : Nat) : loud_spin_lemFuel 0 n = fuelExhausted n := loud_spin_lemFuel_zero n
example (a : Nat) (n : Nat) : climb_lemFuel 0 a n = 998 := climb_lemFuel_zero a n
example (n : Nat) : @outer_lemFuel ⟨3⟩ 0 n = fuelExhausted n := @outer_lemFuel_zero ⟨3⟩ n
example (n : Nat) : @mping_lemFuel ⟨3⟩ 0 n = 995 := @mping_lemFuel_zero ⟨3⟩ n
example (n : Nat) (u : Unit) : wild_spin_lemFuel 0 n u = 997 := wild_spin_lemFuel_zero n u
example (p : Nat × Nat) : tup_spin_lemFuel 0 p = 996 := tup_spin_lemFuel_zero p

/-! ### (3) sufficient fuel: two different fuels, the same value -/
example : @spin ⟨6⟩ 5 = 0 := by decide
example : @spin ⟨1000⟩ 5 = 0 := by decide
example : @uses_uses_spin ⟨100⟩ 2 = 2 := by decide
example : @uses_uses_spin ⟨5⟩ 2 = 2 := by decide
example : @maps_spin ⟨10⟩ [1, 2, 3] = [0, 0, 0] := by decide
example : @tup_spin ⟨10⟩ (3, 4) = 7 := by decide
example : @wild_spin ⟨10⟩ 3 () = 0 := by decide

/-! ### (4) insufficient fuel: exactly the declared sentinel — nothing else
    (there is no default to fall back on) -/
example : @spin ⟨5⟩ 5 = 999 := by decide
example : @uses_spin ⟨5⟩ 5 = 1000 := by decide

/-! ### (5) a fuel'd callee starts from the FULL ambient: outer 3 needs 4
    counter steps and then spin 3 needs 4 of its own — at ambient 4 both
    complete. (Under "pass the remaining counter" semantics spin would
    receive 0 and this would read 999.) -/
example : @outer ⟨4⟩ 3 = 0 := by decide
example : @mping ⟨3⟩ 2 = 0 := by decide

/-! ### (6) fuel × reader (wrapper: instance, then reader-first) and
    fuel × reader_seed (the seed def is fuel-lifted; its first argument
    seeds the reader) -/
example : @uses_climb ⟨100⟩ 10 3 = 10 := by decide
example : @seeded_climb ⟨100⟩ 10 3 = 10 := by decide
example : @seeded_climb ⟨3⟩ 10 3 = 998 := by decide

/-! ### (7) a value binding is a function of the instance -/
example : @spun_value ⟨100⟩ = 0 := by decide
example : @spun_value ⟨7⟩ = 999 := by decide

/-! ### (8) a fuel_consumer reads the same ambient its callers carry -/
example : @uses_consumer ⟨42⟩ 1 = 43 := by decide

/-! ### (9) an entry point instantiates once (`letI`) -/
example : (letI : LemFuel := ⟨50⟩; uses_spin 7) = 1 := by decide

/-! ### (10) the contextual-keyword test's own fuel declare still works -/
example : @count_down ⟨100⟩ 5 = 0 := by decide

/-! ### (11) the ∀-fuel statement shape: above the depth, the value does
    not depend on the fuel -/
