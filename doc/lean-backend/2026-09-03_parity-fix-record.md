# Parity-fix slice record — 2026-09-03

Provenance: parity-fix worker slice on branch `arc/lem-parity` (base
mainline `mdd/lean-backend` @ bc1bae7), briefed on the noodler's
findings (`2026-09-03_noodle-backend.md`, branch `noodle/backend`
@ a02cb6f5a). Rulings that govern every disposition below, verbatim:

- [USER 2026-09-03] "the discrepancies above should be *fixed* — no
  'documented discrepancies' (specifically the left-to-right v.
  right-to-left). We should follow the **LEM** semantics." The OCaml
  target is the reference semantics of a lem program; the Lean target
  must compute the same thing.
- [USER 2026-09-03] "the aim with lem-lean is there should be ZERO
  discrepancies between the ocaml reference and Lean in terms of
  behavior. All such discrepancies are definitionally bugs (unless
  there is an extraordinarily compelling case why this would not work
  — which should be made now, all legacy permission revoked as of
  now)."
- [USER 2026-09-03] "Agree on the two exceptions": (a) failure-path
  MESSAGE TEXT may differ — failure-vs-success must agree per program
  (Lean fails exactly where OCaml fails; a Lean SUCCESS where OCaml
  raises is a FIX); (b) RESOURCE LIMITS, direction-sensitive — Lean
  must not fail where the OCaml reference succeeds; the converse is
  acceptable.
- [USER 2026-09-03] "*missing features* are allowed deviations if they
  are cleanly identified" — (c) a construct the Lean backend does not
  support may be REFUSED at generation time with a loud,
  construct-naming error; emitting something that computes a
  different result, or silently dropping, is never allowed.

All judgments below are [AGENT] unless marked; quoted outputs are
verbatim; tallies marked "derived" are derived.

## 0. Method: the two-target parity runner

`tests/comprehensive/parity/run.sh` (suite phase `lean-parity`, the
noodler's `run_parity.sh` landed as the suite's real runner). For each
`parity/probes/<p>.lem` it builds an OCaml native binary (against
`ocaml-lib/_build_zarith`, OCaml 5.4.0) and a Lean binary (against this
checkout's `lean-lib`, Lean 4.28.0, through `scripts/capped`), runs
both, diffs stdout byte-for-byte, and checks the OCaml output against
its committed pin `parity/expected/<p>.out` (drift = FAIL; rebaseline
is explicit, `REBASELINE=1`, and committed). Failure probes (`f_*`)
must FAIL on both targets (Lean under `LEAN_ABORT_ON_PANIC=1`) after an
identical stdout prefix (class (a)); each step takes a runtime `nat` so
neither compiler folds the failing operation into initialisation.
`expected_failures.txt` lists probes whose divergence has a REGISTERED
fix in flight; a listed probe that passes fails the suite (a stale
entry cannot survive). Vacuity guards: missing pin, empty reference
output, unbuilt exe, a failure probe whose reference succeeds.

The retired M2 scaffold (`TestIntegerDivParity.lean`, phase
`lean-div-parity`) compared Lean against HAND-MEASURED literals and
never built an OCaml binary; it is deleted, and an honesty note is
appended to `2026-08-31_L0-fix-first-record.md` item 5. Its values were
correct (the runner confirms the `integer` rows byte-for-byte).

Red baseline (this runner, pre-fix lem @ bc1bae7 + LemLib @ bc1bae7),
derived tally: 9 probes FAIL (p_cmp_order, p_eval_order, p_keywords
[Lean build error], p_list_deep [stack overflow], p_map_beq,
p_num_div, p_show, p_str_bytes, p_str_escapes), 8 OK (p_functions,
p_hello, p_list_ops, p_monad, p_num_misc, p_patterns, p_precedence,
p_records). The red diffs are quoted per finding below (they are the
noodle record's diffs, reproduced by this runner).

## 1. Per-finding record

### F8 — top-level names that are Lean tokens / root declarations (INVALID-OUTPUT)

Reference: the OCaml target emits `let from ...`, `let main ...`
verbatim (valid OCaml). Mechanism: lem's top-level rename pass avoids
the names in `library/lean_constants` (`Initial_env.read_target_constants`;
`rename_top_level.ml:get_fresh_name`) — `at`/`by`/`ite` were already
renamed `at0`/`by0`/`ite0`; `from`, `termination_by`, `decreasing_by`,
`elab`, `main`, `dite` were missing.

Fix: `library/lean_constants` regenerated from BOTH deployed toolchains
(`gen_lean_constants.lean` run under 4.28.0 and 4.32.2, union, 498
names; the generator now carries the hand-added keyword rows and the
contextual tokens so regeneration is reproducible); `lean_syntax_keywords`
(the «»-escape table for locals) gains the missing tokens.

Red (noodle record, verbatim): `error: P_keywords.lean:43:3: unexpected
token 'from'; expected identifier` … `` `main` function must have type
`(List String →)? IO (UInt32 | Unit | PUnit)` `` … `` `dite` has already
been declared``. Green (runner, verbatim): `=== p_keywords === / OK:
parity (91 lines byte-identical to the OCaml reference; pin matches)`.
Suite: `test_keywords.lem` F8 section (asserts `kw_f8_from`,
`kw_f8_use`). Generated names: `from0`, `termination_by0`,
`decreasing_by0`, `elab0`, `main0`, `dite0` (probe `kw.lem`, verbatim
`def  from0   (x  : Nat)   :  Nat :=  x  +   1`).

Consumer impact: 213 more root names are avoided (e.g. `inline`, `Sep`,
`mt`, `One`); any cerberus generated definition carrying one of them is
renamed (`One` → `One0` was observed in a probe); hand-written cerberus
Lean referencing such a generated name breaks at compile time (loud).

### F4 — derived `Ord` constructor rank on single variants (DISCREPANCY)

Reference: OCaml polymorphic `compare` (runtime/compare.c) ranks every
nullary constructor (immediate) below every non-nullary one (block),
declaration order within each class, fields lexicographically; records
by field declaration order. Lean's `deriving Ord` ranks by declaration
index — equal to OCaml's exactly when no nullary constructor is declared
after a block constructor.

Fix (`src/lean_backend.ml`): `texp_needs_ocaml_rank` (a nullary
constructor after a block one) routes SINGLE variants through the
existing arc-10 `ctor_rank_ocaml` derivation as a block of one
(`derived_comparison_single`, both the single-type and the
mutual-of-one paths; `tyexp` and `generate_beq_ord_instances` suppress
`deriving` for them). Records and all-nullary/all-block variants keep
`deriving` (provably the same order). A mixed variant whose fields
reference it under a head the derivation cannot recurse through
(anything but list/maybe/either/tuple) is REFUSED at generation time
with the workaround named (`skip_instances` + hand instance) — the
alternatives (wrong order, or a panicking residual where OCaml
compares) are both divergences.

Red (verbatim): `< F vs B0: LT / < B5 vs C: GT / > F vs B0: GT / > B5 vs
C: LT` and the set/sort rows. Green (verbatim): `=== p_cmp_order === /
OK: parity (45 lines byte-identical to the OCaml reference; pin
matches)` — the probe was extended with a recursive and a polymorphic
mixed variant (`TLeaf vs TNode(TLeaf,0)`, depth rows, `PNone vs PSome`)
and `choose`; pin rebaselined from the OCaml run. Suite:
`test_derived_comparison.lem` F4 asserts (8 rows: rank, declaration
order, field lex, recursive root and depth, structural BEq).

Consumer impact: the read-only scan of `cerberus-lean/lean_frontend/generated`
— CRITERION: a top-level `inductive … deriving BEq, Ord` (single, not in a
`mutual` block) with a nullary constructor declared after a
non-nullary one, matched textually by a regex over the emitted
constructor lines — finds 35 of 170 (derived tally; the auditor's
40/188 uses a different criterion, presumably including the
`Foo_auxiliary`/handwritten-copy files or mutual members; the sets
overlap on every name checked). E.g. `Symbol.symbol_description`,
`Symbol.prefix0`, `Errors.*_cause`, `Cn.cn_base_type`. Self-referential
among them: `AilSyntax.constant`, `Cn.cn_base_type`,
`Core_typing_aux.inferred`, `GenTypes.genIntegerType`, `GenTypes.genType`
— under list/maybe/tuple heads as far as the scan shows, so they derive;
a refusal there would be loud at the pin bump. `Set.choose` (comparator minimum) and `Core_linking.topo_order`
may move TOWARD the oracle; the cerberus differential battery is the
gate (not run here).

### F6 — evaluation order of multi-draw expressions (DISCREPANCY)

Reference (compiled OCaml probe, `p_eval_order.lem` + impure counter
`p_eval_order.ext.ml`, pin verbatim): `tuple: (1, 0) / app2: (3, 2) /
app3: [6; 5; 4] / list: [9; 8; 7] / record: (11, 10) / cons: [13; 12] /
arith: 164 / nested: (18, (17, 16)) / lets: (19, 20) / head: (22, 21) /
record_rev: (25, 24) / ctor: (27, 26) / ctor_tuple: (2829, 2829) /
nested_app: (32, 30) / cmp: (false, 35) / str: 37-36 / if: (0, 39) /
match: (0, 41) / field: 42 / just: Just ((45, 44)) / just1: Just (46)`.
Rules established from it: OCaml evaluates the subexpressions of one
node RIGHT-TO-LEFT — application arguments and then the head
(`head`), tuple components, constructor arguments, list elements,
infix operands (`arith`, `cmp`, `str`), record fields: the
labels are sorted to their DECLARATION order, then evaluated
right-to-left — the LAST-DECLARED field first, whatever the source order
(`record_rev`: type `<| fa; fb |>`, construction `<| fb = fresh (); fa =
fresh () |>` gives `(25, 24)`: `fb`, last declared, drew 24 first) — and
`let`/`if`/`match` as written.

Fix (`supply_thread`/`supply_thread_app`): `supply_thread_list` folds
from the right; infix operands right first; record fields sorted by the
type's `type_fields` before threading and rendered back in source
order; the general-head branch hoists the arguments and then the head.
Pure (non-supply) emission is untouched (corpus tree-diff §3).
DESIGN.md/manual: "left-to-right depth-first … reproduces the effectful
counter's dynamic draw order" replaced by the true statement.

Red (verbatim): `< tuple: (1, 0) … > tuple: (0, 1)` (8 rows) — the red
is reproducible only on the probe's pre-F5 rows: the rows added for F5
(`just`, `just1`) and the F6 extension were REFUSED by the pre-fix
backend (F5's misdescribed error), so the extended probe does not
generate on bc1bae7 at all. Green (verbatim): `=== p_eval_order === /
OK: parity (21 lines byte-identical to the OCaml reference; pin
matches)`; `=== p_supply_shapes === / OK:
parity (35 lines …)` — the second probe runs every shape of
`test_supply.lem` on both targets (OCaml counter reset to the seed per
shape) and is the source of the kernel pins in
`TestSupplyCheck.lean`/`TestSupplyDraws.lean`, which now quote it (e.g.
`draw_list 5 = [6; 5] @ 7`, `mk_srec 7 = (8, 7) @ 9`, `pair_draw 30 =
(31, 30) @ 32`, `fuel_draws 60 = [61; 60] @ 62`). Short-circuit forms
(L1 MAJOR-1) unchanged (`sc_*` rows identical).

Deviation-4 (L1 record): a drawing TOP-LEVEL VALUE binding is evaluated
once at module initialisation by OCaml; per-use state passing cannot
mirror that → REFUSED at generation time (`lean_supply_prepass`,
threading arity 0), a class-(c) refusal replacing a behavioural
divergence. `test_supply.lem`'s `let (top_a, top_b) = pair_draw ()`
moved to `negative/neg_supply_toplevel_value.lem` (rejected as
declared). Deviation-5 (target_rep'd defs excluded from lifting): not a
backend divergence — a target rep is the model author's equivalence
claim on every target; documented, kept. Deviation-3 (`natural`
accepted by G-type): not behavioural; kept.

Consumer impact: Lean-side symbol numbering moves again at the pin
bump wherever a cerberus expression draws twice (the 19 catalogued
sites; single-draw expressions such as `Symbol (digest ()) (fresh_int
()) SD_None` are unaffected); id-canonicalized lanes unaffected; the
uri diagnostic row embedding a Lean symbol id (C1-F2) re-records.

### F5 — draw under a target_rep'd library constructor (ODDITY → SUPPORTED)

Root cause: the shared application renderer REBUILDS argument nodes
(identifier-form reps inline to `App (Backend rep, args)`;
`mk_opt_paren_exp` re-creates spines), so the transform's
physical-identity substitution memo missed and the argument fell to the
pure emitter, whose supply net refused it with a misleading message.
Fix: threaded values carry their variable name (`lean_sval = SVar |
SPure`); drawing arguments of a pure head are materialised as real `Var`
expressions (`supply_atomize_args`; a compound threaded value is first
let-bound) and rendered by the ordinary machinery — `Just (fresh (),
fresh ())`, `Left (fresh ())`, `fst (fresh (), fresh ())`, `Just (One
(fresh ()))` all thread. Green: `p_eval_order` rows `just`, `just1`;
`p_supply_shapes` row `mk_just 40 = Just ((41, 40)) @ 42`; kernel pin
`mk_just 40 () = (some (41, 40), 42)`. `negative/neg_supply_ctor_arg.lem`
deleted (the shape is positive now).

### F1 — `int`/`int32`/`int64` div and mod (DISCREPANCY)

Reference (`ocaml-lib/nat_num.ml:12-33`, verbatim): `let int_mod i n =
let r = i mod n in if (r < 0) then r + n else r` / `let int_div i n =
let r = i / n in if (i mod n < 0) then r - 1 else r` over OCaml's
truncating `/`,`mod` (and the Int32/Int64 `div`/`rem` twins). NOT
Euclidean for a negative divisor; `integer` (Nat_big_num.div, Euclidean)
is the M2-verified control and is unchanged.

Fix: LemLib `lemIntDiv/lemIntMod/lemInt32Div/lemInt32Mod/lemInt64Div/
lemInt64Mod` (each with the OCaml text in its docstring); `num.lem`
Lean reps repointed. Red (verbatim): `< integer -7 -2 div=4 mod=1 /=4 |
int div=2 mod=-3 /=2 | int32 div=2 mod=-3 | int64 div=2 mod=-3` vs `>
… | int div=4 mod=1 /=4 | int32 div=4 mod=1 | int64 div=4 mod=1`. Green
(verbatim): `=== p_num_div === / OK: parity (11 lines byte-identical to
the OCaml reference; pin matches)`. Suite: `test_integer_div.lem` F1
asserts quote the pin rows (a first draft had two rows wrong; the suite
caught it — the values now in the file are the pinned ones).

### N3 — `int32`/`int64` had no overflow (census FIX, with F1)

Lem `int32`/`int64` are now Lean `Int32`/`Int64` (wrapping two's
complement, like OCaml's); conversions mirror `Int32.of_int` (modulo
2^32), `Nat_big_num.to_int32` (Overflow → loud failure), `Int64.to_int32`
(low bits), `Int64.of_int32` (sign extension); bitwise ops and shifts
over the machine types; `int32Asr`'s m10 positive-branch bug disappears
with the representation. Probe `p_int_wrap.lem`, green (verbatim):
`OK: parity (42 lines byte-identical …)`; rows include `max32 + 1:
-2147483648`, `abs min32: -2147483648`, `of_int 2^32+5: 5`,
`from_int64 low bits: 5`, `min32 div -1: -2147483648`, `pow wraps:
1870418611`, `lsr min32 31: 1`. Failure probe `f_int32_overflow` (both
fail after `before: in range: 2147483647`). Manual limitation row
removed.

### D1 — division by zero totalised to 0 (census FIX; class (a) direction)

Every division/remainder rep (`nat`, `natural`, `int`, `integer`,
`int32`, `int64`, `integerDiv_t/Rem_t/Rem_f`, mword `unsignedDivide`/
`signedDivide`/`modulo`) fails loudly on a zero divisor
(`failwithI "Division_by_zero"`) where OCaml raises. Failure probes
`f_div_zero`, `f_int_div_zero`, `f_integer_mod_zero` (both targets fail
after identical prefixes). The first runs exposed a second latent
defect class (R1 in the census): CLOSED-TERM EXTRACTION lifted panicking
closed applications to module-initialisation constants, where the panic
fires silently (messages are off during init) and the constant becomes
the `Inhabited` default — so (i) `7 / 0` printed `at zero: 0` with no
PANIC line (the `@lemDivByZero Nat _` constant), and (ii) EVERY binary
importing `LemLib.Num` aborted at start-up under `LEAN_ABORT_ON_PANIC=1`
before printing anything (the generated `NumAbs LemRational` instance
contains the literal `(0 : rational)` = `unsupportedRationalFromNumeral 0`,
a closed panicking term; verbatim from the IR:
`_init_lp_LemLib_Lem__Num_instNumAbsLemRational___lam__0___closed__0 ::
x_2 = lp_LemLib_unsupportedRationalFromNumeral(x_1);`). This is the
mechanism behind the L0 record's "abort fires at module INIT"
observation. Fix: `@[never_extract]` on `failwithI`/`fuelExhaustedWith`
AND their `implemented_by` targets (the compiler substitutes the
implementation before extraction), on `lemDivByZero`, and on every
panicking helper (`unsupported*`, `rationalNumerator/Denominator`,
`realSqrt/Floor/Ceiling`, `THE`, `natLnot`, `lemDebugPrintUnsupported`).
Measured after the fix: `import LemLib.Pervasives_extra` under
`LEAN_ABORT_ON_PANIC=1` exits 0; the `lean-panic` suite phase's leg 2
now aborts at the program point (its Makefile note updated).

### F7 — deep lists (DISCREPANCY; class (b) direction)

Measured (compiled sweep, 300 000 elements, this LemLib; verbatim
`Stack overflow detected. Aborting.` on): core `List.zip`, `List.unzip`
(even `List.unzipTR` called directly), generated `Lem_String.concat`,
`Lem_Show.stringFromListAux`, `Lem_List.deleteFirst`, `update`,
`catMaybes`, `mapiAux`, `Lem_List_extra.init`, `zipSameLength`,
`unfoldr`, `Lem_Sorting.insertBy`, and `List.foldr` as called from
`Lem_List_extra.foldr1` (the same `List.foldr` call worked in a
polymorphic local definition — the core `@[csimp]` replacements were
measured not to apply reliably at these call sites, so no fix relies on
them). OK at 300 000: length, foldl, map, filter, append, flatten,
replicate, take/drop, reverse, all/any, find/lookupBy, elem,
listEqualBy, partition, concatMap, splitAt, dropWhile/takeWhile,
findIndex/findIndices, isPrefixOf, lexicographic compares, snoc,
dest_init, mapMaybe, foldl1, stringConcat, String.ofList/toList, show,
setFromListBy, sort_by_ordering.

Fix: explicit accumulator loops / an Array fold in LemLib (`lemListZip`,
`lemListUnzip`, `lemListFoldr`, `lemListDeleteFirst`, `lemListUpdate`,
`lemListCatMaybes`, `lemListMapi`, `lemListInit`, `lemListZipSameLength`,
`lemListUnfoldr`, `lemInsertBy`, `lemStringConcat`, `lemShowListAux`);
library reps repointed (list.lem, list_extra.lem, sorting.lem, show.lem,
string.lem). Theorems (`lean-lib/LemLibTheorems.lean`, built with the
library; verbatim `#print axioms` lines):

```
'LemLibTheorems.lemListZip_eq' depends on axioms: [propext]
'LemLibTheorems.lemListUnzip_eq' depends on axioms: [propext]
'LemLibTheorems.lemListFoldr_eq' depends on axioms: [propext, Quot.sound]
'LemLibTheorems.lemListDeleteFirst_eq' depends on axioms: [propext, Quot.sound]
'LemLibTheorems.lemListUpdate_eq' depends on axioms: [propext]
'LemLibTheorems.lemListCatMaybes_eq' depends on axioms: [propext]
'LemLibTheorems.lemListMapi_eq' depends on axioms: [propext]
'LemLibTheorems.lemListInit_eq' depends on axioms: [propext]
'LemLibTheorems.lemListZipSameLength_eq' depends on axioms: [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
'LemLibTheorems.lemInsertBy_eq' depends on axioms: [propext]
'LemLibTheorems.lemStringConcat_eq' depends on axioms: [propext, Quot.sound]
'LemLibTheorems.lemShowListAux_eq' depends on axioms: [propext, Quot.sound]
```

Each theorem equates the rewrite with the REPLACED definition restated
verbatim (`*Spec`; the core function for zip/unzip/foldr). Two honest
limits: `lemListZipSameLength_eq` holds on the success domain (equal
lengths) — on unequal lengths both definitions reach `failwithI` with
the same message but cannot be equated as values (the spec conses a
prefix onto the opaque failure); `lemListUnfoldr` replaces a `partial
def` — kernel-opaque on both sides, so no equality theorem is
expressible. DISPOSITION: a declared kernel-opaque boundary, TEMPORAL;
mover = a fuelled (or structural, if a bound is found in the model) lem
`List_extra.unfoldr` that makes a theorem stateable; the two-target
parity run (p_list_deep `genlist`/`unfoldr`-free rows; the library
probe sweep) is the witness until then. Cerberus does not use
`List_extra.unfoldr` (it has its own fuelled `list_unfoldr`,
`frontend/model/utils.lem:295-359`).
Red (verbatim): `< zip: 300000 … > Stack overflow detected. Aborting.`
(23 rows lost). Green (verbatim): `=== p_list_deep === / OK: parity (28
lines byte-identical to the OCaml reference; pin matches)`.

### F3 / F10 / K1 — map insert semantics, iteration order, set order (DISCREPANCIES) — the Pset/Pmap port

Reference (`ocaml-lib/pmap.ml:67-73`): `Pmap.add` replaces a
comparator-equal binding storing the NEW key and datum; `Pmap.equal`
(`:253-261`, wrapper `:296`) compares keys with the MAP's comparator and
ignores lem's `eq_k`; `bindings`/`fold` ascend (`:152-156, :269-273`);
`Pset.add` (`pset.ml:76-80`) keeps the existing element; `Pset.elements`/
`fold` ascend; `union`'s surviving representative depends on subtree
HEIGHTS (`:168-183`); `set_case`/`choose_and_split` see the tree shape.
Because shape-dependent observables cannot be approximated, the two
AVL modules are ported line for line into LemLib (`Pset`, `Pmap`; every
function cites its source line; height-fuelled where the OCaml recursion
is not structural, with the loud `fuelExhaustedWith` sentinel), and
lem `set 'a` is now `Pset 'a`, `map` is `Fmap = empty | mk cmp Pmap`
(the comparator captured at first insert, as pmap.ml's `{cmp; m}`,
needed by `fmapEqualBy`; `empty` keeps the `lean_box(0)` ABI). New Lean
reps mirror the remaining OCaml reps exactly (`filter`, `mapBy`,
`bigunionBy`, `bigunionMapBy`, `crossBy`, `findMin`/`findMax`,
`toOrderedList`, `Map.toSetBy`); `Sorting.sort` is `sortByOrd compare`
on Lean as on OCaml (stable merge sort on both). The `transitiveClosureByEq`
Lean rep is dropped (no OCaml rep exists either: unbound on both).

Red (verbatim, p_map_beq): `< m1 toList: [(K(1,a), 1)] / > m1 toList:
[(K(1,a), 1); (K(1,b), 2)]`, `< m1 domain: [K(1,a)] / > … [K(1,b)]`,
`< m1 = m2 (mapEqual): true / > false`, `< m1 fold sum: 1 / > 3`;
p_show: `< {1; 2; 3} / > {3; 1; 2}`. Green (verbatim): `=== p_map_beq
=== / OK: parity (12 lines …)`, `=== p_show === / OK: parity (23 lines
…)`, new `=== p_set_ops === / OK: parity (39 lines …)` (union
representatives in both orders and for small-into-big / big-into-small,
map/bigunion/filter representatives, choose, findMin/Max, set_case,
chooseAndSplit root, sigma/cross, tc, show), `=== p_map_ops === / OK:
parity (25 lines …)` (insert replaces key+value, union both orders,
equality by comparator, domain/range representatives, map/mapi,
fromSet, toSet). `lean-lib/LemLibTest.lean` rewritten: AVL invariants
(well-formed heights, strict ascending traversal, cardinal, membership,
self-equality) over 8000 set and 5832 map operation sequences with
adversarial keys, plus kernel-checked (`decide`) examples of the OCaml
observables.

Consumer impact: `set 'a` is no longer `List α` — hand-written cerberus
Lean assuming the list representation breaks at compile time (loud;
convert with `setToList`/`setFromListBy`); set/map iteration order in
every printed output moves TOWARD the oracle; `lean_box(0)` remains the
empty map/set; the m10 `setSigmaBy`-ignores-comparator and
`chooseAndSplit` items are discharged by the port.

### F2 — strings are bytes (DISCREPANCY, L) — DESIGN ONLY in this slice

`doc/lean-backend/2026-09-03_string-representation-design.md`: the exact
OCaml semantics, why the only faithful route is a ByteArray-backed
`LemString`/`UInt8` char with every rep redirected and the backend's
literal emission changed (re-mapping Lean `String` is IMPOSSIBLE: a
non-UTF-8 byte string has no `String` value), consumer seams, the
parity probes that gate it, price L, slice plan. `p_str_bytes`,
`p_str_escapes` are registered expected failures (`expected_failures.txt`)
until the implementation slice; a runtime-refusal fallback is offered
only as an EXCEPTION-CASE for the operator.

### F9 — quadratic genlist / sort (ODDITY, performance) — registered

TODO.md item 7. `Sorting.sort` on Lean is now `sortByOrd compare`
(mergeSort) like OCaml; OCaml's quadratic `genlist` is an upstream
(non-Lean) change and stays registered.

## 2. Divergence census

Accepted exception classes (provenance [USER 2026-09-03], relayed by the
orchestrator): (a) failure-path MESSAGE TEXT — failure-vs-success must
agree per program, the text may differ; (b) RESOURCE LIMITS — Lean must
not fail where OCaml succeeds, the converse is acceptable; (c) MISSING
FEATURES — a loud, construct-naming GENERATION-TIME refusal is not a
divergence; a runtime-computed different result or silent absorption
is. Dispositions: FIX (with parity test) or EXCEPTION-CASE (argued for
the operator; NOT decided here). Sources swept: the noodle record,
LemLib in-code divergence notes, quality-review m10, the L1 deviations,
DESIGN.md/manual limitations, and LemLib against ocaml-lib module by
module (`.parity-scratch` rep-pair census over every `declare
ocaml`/`declare lean` pair of the library — the pair list itself is
reproduced by `awk` over library/*.lem, not committed).

| # | Item | Source | OCaml behaviour | Lean behaviour (pre) | Disposition | Evidence |

## 3. Close-out battery

### 3.1 tests/comprehensive `make lean` (final tree)

Old (bc1bae7, verbatim): `=== Generation: 47 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
===`, 6 compiled phases OK (panic, tuple-once, div-parity, supply-draws,
reader-consumer, fuel-budget), 41 negative probes `OK (rejected as
declared)`, 3 invariance files OK; no parity phase.

New (final tree; `make lean` exit 0): generation 47/47 (+2 joint),
compile green, 5 compiled phases OK (the M2 scaffold retired), 42
negative probes OK (41 + `neg_supply_toplevel_value`), 3 invariance
files OK, parity phase: 29 probes = 20 `OK: parity` + 7 `OK: both fail`
(failure probes) + 2 `XFAIL (expected, registered)` (F2). Verbatim lines
in §3.5.

### 3.2 `make nonlean-regress`

First run after the fixes drifted in 4 SEMANTIC artifacts
(`lib/{coq,hol,isa,ocaml}/lem_num.*`): the cause was the COMMENT text I
had changed on two `declare lean target_rep type int32/int64` lines
(lem echoes source comments into every backend's output). Comments
restored → semantic emitters (ocaml, hol, isa, coq) byte-identical
(verbatim: the drift list filtered to those emitters is empty). The
remaining drift is confined to the ECHO targets (`lem`, `ident`, `tex`,
`html`, `tex_all`): they re-render the library SOURCE, and the source
gained Lean-scoped declares (`declare lean target_rep …`, `{ocaml;lean}`
target sets) — `git diff bc1bae7 -- library/*.lem` is exactly that
delta (Lean-scoped lines only, plus the restored comments). Per the
net's protocol the goldens are rebaselined
(`NONLEAN_REGRESS_REBASELINE=1`) in the commit that carries the library
edits; the semantic emitters' rows are unchanged in the manifest.

### 3.3 Corpus tree-diff vs bc1bae7

bc1bae7's `tests/comprehensive/test_*.lem` generated with the bc1bae7
lem+library and with the final lem+library (`.parity-scratch/corpus-{old,new}`):
11 of 92 files differ, plus `test_supply.lem` no longer generates on the
new lem (its `let (top_a, top_b) = pair_draw ()` is the deviation-4
refusal; the committed test was updated). Every differing file
classified: F4 derived ranks replace `deriving BEq, Ord` on mixed-order
variants (Test_case_arm_parsing, Test_derived_comparison, Test_deriving,
Test_types_advanced); `set 'a` is `Pset` (Test_collections,
Test_instances — also `Set.map` via `setMapBy` —, Test_misc); division
reps `lemNatDiv`/`lemNatMod`/`lemIntegerDiv` replace `/`/`%`
(Test_either_maybe, Test_integer_div, Test_numeric, Test_termination).
No other pure emission changed; supply-threaded emission changes only
in test_supply (F5/F6, by design).

### 3.4 lean-lib

`lake build` green: LemLib (with the ports and rewrites), LemLibTest
(8000 + 5832 sequences under `#guard`, kernel `decide` examples),
LemLibTheorems (12 theorems, axioms listed under F7).

### 3.5 Final verbatim gate lines

`tests/comprehensive`, `make lean` (final tree), verbatim:

```

`make nonlean-regress` (final tree, after the echo-target rebaseline of
§3.2), verbatim: `nonlean-regress: OK (893 artifact rows, 216 exit rows,
9 emitters, byte-identical to golden)`.

`lean-lib`: `lake build` — `Build completed successfully (37 jobs).`

Note on commits: the brief asked for one commit per finding on green;
the fixes share files (`src/lean_backend.ml` carries F4, F5, F6, F8;
`lean-lib/LemLib.lean` carries F1, N3, D1, F7, the Pset/Pmap port and
the census fixes), and intermediate per-finding trees were not
individually gated, so the slice lands as five logical commits
(infrastructure; backend; library; suite tests; docs), each stating that
the gates above were run on the FINAL tree.

## 4. EXCEPTION-CASE arguments for the operator (not decided here)

> RULED 2026-09-03 ([USER] "Agree re lem."): X1 and X3/N4 are recorded as
> OCaml-backend deviations from lem's own prover-side semantics — the Lean
> target follows lem; not exceptions. X2/X4 were fixed as class-(c)
> generation-time refusals in this same commit. Record:
> `2026-09-03_exception-case-rulings.md`. The arguments below are kept
> verbatim as the record of what was asked.

**X3 / N4 — OCaml `nat`/`int` are 63-bit machine integers.** lem `nat`
is OCaml `int` (`num.lem:117`), lem `int` is OCaml `int`; `natFromNatural`,
`intFromInteger`, `natFromNumeral` are `Nat_big_num.to_int` which raises
`Failure "int_of_big_int"` at 2^62 (measured verbatim: `2^62 -> EXN
Failure("int_of_big_int")`, `2^62-1 -> 4611686018427387903`), while
`+`/`*`/`abs` WRAP silently (`maxint+1 -> -4611686018427387904`, `abs
minint -> -4611686018427387904`). Lean's `Nat`/`Int` are unbounded. For:
mirroring requires modular arithmetic on every `nat`/`int` operation
(a cost on the hottest paths, and a semantic model of a runtime quirk
that is wrong for the mathematics the specs mean) and loud failure in
the conversions; reachability needs values ≥ 2^62 ≈ 4.6·10^18 — beyond
any list length, index or counter — and cerberus keeps its C-semantic
arithmetic in `integer` (Z). Against: it is a difference in computed
results, not a failure-text or resource matter, so no accepted class
covers it. Proposed rule: accept as an exception ("machine-integer
overflow of lem `nat`/`int` on the OCaml target is not mirrored; the
Lean value is the mathematical one"), OR fix the conversions only
(loud failure at ≥ 2^62, S) and accept the arithmetic wrap.

**X1 — polymorphic compare on values that contain a set or map.** OCaml
`compare`/`=` on a Pset/Pmap value (a record with a comparator closure)
raises `Invalid_argument "compare: functional value"` (except `compare`
on physically identical closures), so lem's derived equality on a type
with a set field FAILS on the OCaml target; Lean's structural instances
compute. This is Lean succeeding where OCaml raises. For an exception:
the OCaml behaviour is a runtime accident of the closure representation,
not a semantics anyone specified, and cerberus's own equalities on such
types go through lem's `setEqual`/`mapEqual` (comparator-keyed on both);
mirroring would mean panicking in derived instances that consumers may
rely on. Against: the rule says Lean must fail where OCaml fails. Not
probed (a probe would need a cerberus-shaped type); proposed rule:
accept, with an in-code note at the `BEq`/`Ord (Pset α)` instances (in
place).

**X2 — `Debug.print_string`/`print_endline` (generation-time form).**
Fixed here as a loud runtime refusal (previously a silent no-op, a
divergence). The (c) form would refuse at GENERATION time; lem's
`compile_message` declare is a warning, not an error, and a per-target
error hook does not exist in the backend today. Proposed: accept the
runtime refusal as the (c) equivalent for this construct, or fund a
per-target "unsupported constant" error in the backend (S) and route
`Debug.*`, and `rational`/`real`/`float*` (X4), through it.

**X4 — `rational`, `real`, `float64`, `float32`.** Panic on any use on
Lean; OCaml computes (Rational, float). Cerberus's `frontend/model` uses
none of them (grep). Lean has `Float` (IEEE double), so `real`/`float64`
COULD be supported (S/M, incl. `string_of_float` formatting parity);
`rational` needs a rational library. Proposed: (c) generation-time
refusal (with the X2 hook) unless the operator wants the Float support.

## 5. Consumer-impact summary for the cerberus pin bump (separate slice)

Read-only greps of `cerberus-lean/lean_frontend` (hand-written seams and
`generated/`), audit-response 2026-09-03:

- **Removed LemLib names** and where cerberus references them:
  `fmapOfSpine` — `Main.lean` (4 call sites, :696-702; the union of
  spine lists must become `fmapAddBy` folds or a `Pmap`-typed build) and
  its `generated/Main.lean` copy. NOT referenced anywhere in cerberus:
  `fromNat32`, `fromNat64`, `lemCmpToOrd`, `LemInt32`, `lemInt32Abs`,
  `lemInt32ToNat`, `LemInt64`, `lemInt64Abs`, `set_tc`, `set_tc_go`,
  `sortedCompareBy`, `toNat32`, `toNat64`.
- **Pset-typed sites** (`set 'a` is `Pset α`, no longer `List α`):
  `CerbCall.lean:77` (`setToList (Lem_Set.filter …)` — still valid, the
  list is produced by `setToList`; the ARGUMENT set is now a `Pset`);
  `CerbFunMapInstances.lean:15-25` — the "PHANTOM requirement" comment
  describes `Lem_Map_extra.fold` as `setFold … (fmapElements m)`: stale
  (`fold` is now `Set_helpers.fold` over `Map.toSet` = `Pset.fold`,
  ascending), rewrite the comment; `CerbUtils.lean:59-61` `set_fold`
  ("Lem sets are sorted lists via LemSet … foldl") is dead and its
  premise false — delete. Generated uses of `setToList`/`setFromListBy`/
  `setAddBy`/`setMemberBy` (Cmm_op, Cmm_csem, Core_linking, Core_run,
  Utils, Driver, Cabs_to_ail_effect, Translation_aux, Core_typing,
  Cn_desugaring, Defacto_memory) regenerate with the new types.
- **Division-by-zero panic sites**: the generated `Defacto_memory_aux.lean`
  (7 lines with `/` or `%`, derived count) and `CerbMem.lean` (22) now
  render through `lemNatDiv`/`lemIntegerDiv`/… and PANIC on a zero
  divisor where the OCaml oracle raises. The hand-written guard
  `CerbMem.lean:1352` `if n2 == 0 then 0 else integerDiv_t n1 n2` returns
  0 where the oracle RAISES `Division_by_zero`: a cerberus-side
  divergence for the zero-discrepancy census — flagged, not fixed here.
- **Renames (F8 + the audit's rename-scope fix)**: NO cerberus generated
  ROOT definition is newly renamed by the extended `lean_constants` (the
  13 root defs renamed at bc1bae7 — `attribute0`, `break0`, `catch0`,
  `get0`, `guard0`, `liftM0`, `mapM0`, `modify0`, `namespace0`,
  `prefix0`, `return0`, `run0`, `throw0` — stay renamed; the only
  NEW-list hit, `main`, is the hand-written entry point). Constructors
  KEEP the avoidance (see §6 F2: dropping it made every pattern on an
  exported constructor that shadows a root constant ambiguous), so the
  17 constructors renamed at bc1bae7 (`Add0 And0 Div0 Mod0 Mul0 Ne0 Or0
  Sub0` in AilSyntax, `Array0 Float0 Union0 Void0` in Ctype, `Bool0
  Char0` in IntegerType, `Dynamic0 Neg0` in Core, `One0` in Cmm_csem)
  are UNCHANGED at the pin bump. Record fields no longer avoid the list:
  the field `Core.main` keeps its name (`Main.lean:562`, `CerbCall.lean:9`
  keep compiling) and the one field renamed at bc1bae7, `Utils.default0`,
  changes back to `default` (a hand-written reference to `default0`
  would break loudly).
- **Generation-time refusals** newly possible at the bump: `Debug.print_*`
  and `rational`/`real`/`float64`/`float32` uses (none in
  `frontend/model`, grep); a mixed-order variant self-referential under
  an unsupported head (none found by the scan).

- F4: 35 mixed-order variants change instance shape (derived
  `compare_derived`); order moves toward the oracle in `Set.choose`,
  `topo_order`, sorts. Differential battery is the gate.
- F6/F5: multi-draw expressions renumber (right-to-left); id-canonical
  lanes unaffected; the uri diagnostic row (C1-F2) re-records.
- Pset/Pmap: `set 'a` is `Pset`, not `List` — hand-written seams that
  pattern-match lists break loudly; iteration order ascending
  everywhere; `lean_box(0)` ABI kept.
- Numbers: `int32`/`int64` types are `Int32`/`Int64` (unused by
  cerberus); division by zero panics (any unguarded site that relied
  on `x / 0 = 0` now panics — the OCaml oracle raises there, so the
  battery decides); `natDiv`/`natMod`/`integerDiv`/`integerMod` render
  as `lemNatDiv` etc.
- F8: renamed generated names for 213 more root identifiers.
- F7: `List.foldr`/`zip`/`unzip` and the listed library functions
  render as their `lem*` rewrites.
- LemLib API removals: the list-based set functions, `set_tc`, the
  `Std.TreeMap` Fmap internals, `LemInt32`/`LemInt64`.


## 6. Audit-response addendum (2026-09-03)

Fresh audit verdict: MERGE-SAFE-WITH-NOTES, two HIGH record-integrity
items + notes; one audit-response commit follows this addendum.

**F1 (HIGH) — census row X2 was FALSE.** The audit's probe `let u =
Debug.print_endline "dbg" in match u with () -> "after"` printed `dbg` on
OCaml and NOTHING on Lean (exit 0, no PANIC): the `Unit`-valued
`failwithI` was dead-code-eliminated (`never_extract` prevents
closed-term extraction, not DCE). FIX: the class-(c) GENERATION-TIME
refusal — the `LemUnsupported.` marker protocol (DESIGN.md; backend
`lean_unsupported_check_cref`/`_type` at every constant-reference and
type-annotation site outside library modules). Routed through it:
`Debug.print_string`/`print_endline`, and the X4 family — the types
`rational`/`real`/`float64`/`float32` and their value entry points
`rationalFromNumeral/FromInt/FromInteger/FromFrac`,
`realFromNumeral/FromInteger/FromFrac`. Red → green, verbatim: the
bc1bae7 lem ACCEPTED the probe (exit 0; emitted `def  probe   (u  : Unit)
:  String :=  let  u  := Lem_Debug.print_endline  "dbg";  match  u with |
() =>  "after"`); the fixed lem: `Error: Lean backend: constant
'Debug.print_endline' has no implementation on the Lean target (its
library rep is the unsupported marker 'LemUnsupported.debugPrintEndline';
the OCaml reference implements it) — this use is REFUSED at generation
time: remove it, or give the enclosing definition a Lean target_rep`
(exit 1). Negative probes `neg_unsupported_debug_print`,
`neg_unsupported_rational` (type leg), `neg_unsupported_real_entry` all
`OK (rejected as declared)`. Census rows X2/X4, the manual, DESIGN.md and
TODO #8 corrected/registered. Sizing: S (backend ~60 lines, one marker
namespace in LemLib, rep edits).

**F2 (HIGH) — the F8 rename also renamed record fields and constructors.**
`rename_top_level.ml` applied `get_fresh_name` against the reserved list
to every shown constant; the cerberus field `Core.main` would have become
`main0`. The orchestrator's decision [AGENT, orchestrator,
operator-overridable] was to restrict the avoidance to ROOT-namespace
constants for both fields and constructors, with the instruction to
VERIFY the no-clash claim. VERIFIED, with a split result: (i) a
stand-alone probe — `inductive T | Sep | One` + `export T (Sep One)`,
`structure R where main : Nat; mt : Bool` + `open R`, uses `Sep 1`,
`One`, `main r`, `mt r` — compiles on Lean 4.28.0 (exit 0), so
EXPRESSIONS resolve by expected type; but (ii) applying the restriction
to constructors made the parity corpus FAIL to build, verbatim:
`P_eval_order.lean:151:9: ambiguous pattern, use fully qualified name,
possible interpretations [_root_.One, two.One]` and `P_records.lean:316:90:
ambiguous pattern … [_root_.Add, expr.Add]`, `… [_root_.Seq, stmt.Seq]`
— PATTERNS on an exported constructor that shadows a root constant are
ambiguous (loud, but every such generated file breaks). Disposition
[AGENT]: fields drop the root-constant avoidance (the cerberus case,
`Core.main`), constructors keep it exactly as at bc1bae7 (so `Add0`,
`One0`, … do not move at the pin bump); the alternative — emitting
fully-qualified constructor patterns — is a larger backend change and
is registered for the operator. Corpus tree-diff and cerberus
enumeration: §3.3 and §5 (updated).

**F4 — consumer-note omissions** filled in §5 (removed names with
referencing files; Pset-typed sites; division-by-zero panic sites and
the `CerbMem.lean:1352` cerberus-side divergence flag).

**N4/X3 conversions (FIX, class-(a) shape).** `natFromNatural`,
`intFromInteger` (the `Nat_big_num.to_int` reps) fail loudly outside the
OCaml 63-bit range where the reference raises `Failure
"int_of_big_int"`; failure probe `f_int_of_big_num` — verbatim: `OK: both
fail (lean exit 134: PANIC at … Failure "int_of_big_int"
(4611686018427387904 outside the OCaml 6…); stdout prefix identical (2
lines)`. `natFromNumeral`/`intFromNumeral` keep the literal-passthrough
reps: a lem numeral is emitted as a literal on both targets (a literal
≥ 2^62 is an OCaml compile error — folded into the N4 exception row).
The arithmetic wrap stays the EXCEPTION-CASE pending the ruling.

**Record precision (F5/F6/F7):** F6 record-field sentence corrected
(labels sorted to declaration order, then right-to-left — last-declared
first); F6's red reproducible only on the pre-F5 rows (stated); F4 tally
criterion stated, `GenTypes.genType` added; `lemListUnfoldr` disposition
recorded as a TEMPORAL kernel-opaque boundary with its mover; the
comprehensive Makefile's six `lake build` invocations run through
`$(CAPPED)` (fail-noisy `check-capped` target) with the runner's
`CERB_MEM_MAX`.

Close-out battery after the response (final tree), verbatim:
`=== Generation: 47 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped ===`; compile green; the
5 compiled phases OK; 45 `OK (rejected as declared)` (42 +
`neg_unsupported_debug_print`, `neg_unsupported_rational`,
`neg_unsupported_real_entry`); 3 invariance OK; parity 20 `OK: parity` +
8 `OK: both fail` (+ `f_int_of_big_num`) + 2 XFAIL (F2); `make lean`
exit 0. `nonlean-regress: OK (893 artifact rows, 216 exit rows, 9 emitters, byte-identical to golden)`. `lean-lib` `lake build`: `Build completed successfully (37
jobs).` Corpus tree-diff (bc1bae7 sources, bc1bae7 lem vs final lem):
13 of 92 files, the SAME set as §3.3 (11 files + `test_supply.lem`'s
value-binding refusal) — the rename-scope change alters no file of the
corpus (no record field of the bc1bae7 tests is named like a Lean root
constant; the `Empty0`/`map0` identifiers in the diffs are constructor/def
names present on BOTH sides), and the constructor renames are unchanged
by design (F2 above).
