# Backend hardening: package A (correctness and fail-closed) and package C (cleanup) (2026-10-03)

Branch `arc/backend-hardening` from mainline `mdd/lean-backend` at
`5dfcd25`. This record covers package A of the arc that acts on two
reports of 2026-10-03 against `5dfcd25`: the read-the-code review of the
backend and LemLib (the "code review": items H1, H2, M1, M2, W8, TODO 37)
and the behavioural noodler (the "noodle report": findings 1–6). Package C
(cleanup, no output change) is a later slice; package D is out of scope.

## Rulings (verbatim, operator, 2026-10-03)

- Packages: "A: correctness + fail-closed (Recommended)" and "C: cleanup,
  no output change (Recommended)". C is a later slice; D is not in scope.
- #1 min/max: "Register as deviation".
- #2 the BEq bridge: "Design pass first". Another agent handles it; LemLib's
  instance priorities are not changed here.

Every decision below that is not one of these is [AGENT].

## Method

Each item was reproduced first on `5dfcd25` (the worktree before any
change), then fixed, then given a `tests/comprehensive` test that fails on
the before-fix binary and passes after (§"Plants"). The before-fix binary
is a scratch build of `git archive 5dfcd25`. Lean is 4.32.2; every Lean
invocation ran through `cerberus-lean/scripts/capped`. The consumer inputs
were frozen: Cerberus at `51a7402ce`, linksem at `f54d119`.

## Items

### 1. (#4) The Lean annotation words as `target_rep` parameter names — FIXED

- Reproducer: ``declare ocaml target_rep function foo fuel = `Stdlib.succ` fuel``
  → `File "pk.lem", line 4, character 38: Syntax error`; the same line with
  `x` is accepted; upstream Lem accepts `fuel`.
- Cause: `src/parser.mly` `x_ls : | X x_ls` consumed the raw `X` token, while
  the lexer tokenizes the thirteen annotation words for every target; only
  the `x` nonterminal turned them back into identifiers.
- Fix (shared code): a nonterminal `x_tok` (the `X` token or any of the
  thirteen word tokens, yielding the same `(skips, text)` pair) used by both
  `x` and `x_ls`; `loc ()` spans are unchanged. `ocamlyacc -v`: 2
  shift/reduce, 2 reduce/reduce, 5 rules never reduced — identical to the
  fork before the change and to upstream.
- Non-Lean output: `make nonlean-regress` byte-identical; the drift check
  below. The change accepts programs the fork rejected; it rejects nothing
  it accepted.
- Test: `test_contextual_keywords.lem` — an OCaml `target_rep` with
  parameter `fuel` and a Lean one with parameters `reader supply`, both
  applied and asserted.

### 2. (#5) Record fields named like Lean keywords or structure-generated names — FIXED (escape) / REFUSED (generated names)

- Reproducer: `type r = <| at : nat; other : nat |>` → `structure r where\n  at : Nat`
  (Lean: `unexpected token 'at'`), while the literal `{ «at» := default, … }`
  was escaped; `mk : nat` → `Invalid field name mk: This is the name of the
  structure constructor`; `casesOn` → `(kernel) constant has already been
  declared 'r.casesOn'`.
- Measured (plain Lean 4.32.2, a structure, a recursive structure and the
  single-constructor inductive with accessors — the three shapes the
  backend emits): `mk rec recOn casesOn noConfusion noConfusionType` fail in
  all three; `below brecOn` fail for the recursive structure only;
  `binductionOn ibelow induct sizeOf injEq inj toString default ext ext_iff
  mk_inj sizeOf_spec` are fine.
- Decision [AGENT]: keywords are ESCAPED at every site, so a field keeps
  its name (DESIGN: fields keep their Lem names); the eight generated names
  are REFUSED at generation, naming the field and the Lean declaration —
  escaping cannot help («rec» is rec), the reserved-name pass does not
  rename fields (DESIGN "Reserved-name avoidance"), and a rename would be a
  consumer-visible API change applied across six emission sites.
  `below`/`brecOn` are refused for every record (TODO item 47 notes the
  over-refusal for non-recursive ones).
- Fix: `field_ident_to_output` (projection, literal, update, field update)
  escapes; the new `field_decl_output` is the declaration side at the
  three sites (structure field, mutual-structure field, indexed
  single-constructor field); the accessor defs of a mutual record and the
  positional update escape too; `lean_check_type_block` refuses the
  generated names.
- Tests: `test_records.lem` (thirteen keyword fields: projection, literal,
  update, pattern, equality), `test_mutual_record_order.lem` (keyword
  fields of a mutual record, through the accessors),
  `negative/neg_record_field_mk.lem`, `neg_record_field_casesOn.lem`
  (the inductive form).
- Consumers: neither Cerberus nor linksem has a field in either class
  (grep of the frozen sources); their trees are byte-identical.

### 3. (#6) A type variable named like a type or value in scope — FIXED (values) / REFUSED (type definitions)

- Reproducer: `type t = A | B` with `let f (x : 't) (y : t) : nat = tn y`
  → `def f { t : Type } (x : t) (y : t)` (`y` has type `t` but is expected
  to have type `_root_.t`); `let a : nat = 3` with `let f (x : 'a) : nat = a`
  → `a` has type `Type`.
- Fix: `lean_tyvar_renames_for` collects every name the definition refers
  to — the Lean name of each constant (`exp_constants`), the Lean name and
  the components of a Lean target representation of each type constructor
  in the type of any sub-expression or pattern (`lean_types_of_exp`,
  `lean_types_of_pat`, `lean_type_path_names`) — and a type variable equal
  to one of them is rendered under a fresh PRIMED name (`t'`, `t''`, …) that
  is none of those names, none of the other type variables, none of the
  definition's binders (`exp_bound_names`, `pat_to_bound_names`) and not
  reserved. The map is [render]-scoped (`St.tyvar_renames`, set in
  `val_def`, restored by `Fun.protect`) and consulted by the implicit
  binders, both source-type renderers, the class-constraint binders and the
  comparison-dictionary binders.
  - Why primed: a digit-suffixed candidate met Lem's own renamer, which
    turns a colliding LOCAL binder into `t1` at render time, after the map
    is computed (first attempt: `let t = tn y` became `t1` and so did the
    type variable; the Lean error was `List t1` applied to a `Nat`). Lem's
    renamer (`default_avoid_f`, `Name.fresh`) never produces a prime.
  - Type DEFINITIONS are refused, not renamed [AGENT]: a type parameter's
    name is part of the generated API (`inductive t (a : Type)`, named
    arguments), and the collision is a rare source condition; numeric type
    variables are not renamed (no collision shape known). TODO item 47.
- Tests: `test_tyvar_collision.lem` (type and value collisions, a binder
  named like the first candidate, a nested annotation plus a local named
  like the type), `negative/neg_tyvar_type_param_collision.lem`.
- Consumers: byte-identical trees, so no definition of either mentions a
  name equal to one of its type variables.

### 4. (#8) Mutual-record update does not parenthesise or bind its base — FIXED

- Reproducer (heterogeneous block, `skip_instances`): `<| mkr n with f = 5 |>`
  → `(r.mk 5 (mkr n.g))`, which Lean reads as `mkr (n.g)`; a conditional
  base likewise; and the base was re-rendered per unchanged field.
- Fix: `(let lemRecBase := mkr n; r.mk 5 lemRecBase.g)` — the base is
  bound once. `lemRecBase` joins `lean_reserved_exact_names`; a free
  variable of that name in the base or an updated value, or a constant
  rendering to it (`lean_reserved_capture_check`), is refused.
- Tests: `test_mutual_record_order.lem` (an application base, a
  conditional base), `negative/neg_recup_reserved_base.lem`.

### 5. (#9) Generation exponential in wide wildcard patterns — FIXED

- Reproducer (`lem -lean`, a constructor pattern of N−1 wildcards): N=45
  1.6 s, N=47 >120 s, N=50 >120 s; `-ocaml`, `-coq`, `-hol`, `-isa` on N=47:
  1.4–1.7 s. So the cost was in the Lean pipeline after pattern compilation
  (the Coq pipeline shares `is_coq_exp`/`check_match_exp`).
- Cause (stack sample via a temporary `Sys.catch_break` and `-debug`):
  `Lean_layout.be`/`fits` nested dozens deep. The Wadler/Leijen printer's
  `be` decided a Break-mode group by `fits` over a `Seq.t` candidate, then
  re-ran the same `be` to emit it; OCaml's `Seq` is call-by-name, so every
  consumer recomputed the candidate's tail, and each recomputation
  re-decided every Break-mode group that followed on the line — exponential
  in the number of sibling groups on a line that overflows the width. The
  cliff at 46→47 is where `| C _ _ … z =>` stops fitting in 100 columns.
- Fix (`src/lean_layout.ml`): `Seq.memoize` on the candidate of `Group` and
  `Union` — the call-by-need sharing Wadler's complexity argument assumes.
  The decisions are the same, so the output is unchanged (consumer trees
  byte-identical). After: N=47/50/55 1.7 s, N=150 1.6 s, the noodler's
  `t_tuple60` 1.6 s, `t_ctor60_vars` 1.4 s (was 17.6 s).
- Test: `test_wide_patterns.lem` (a 120-field constructor — under the item 6
  limit — with first/last patterns, 60-tuples), compiled and asserted; the
  suite phase `lean-wide-patterns` generates it under `timeout 60` first in
  the suite (`LEAN_WIDE_PATTERNS_SECONDS`), so a regression fails loudly
  instead of hanging the later phases.

### 6. (#3) Records with 128 or more fields segfault at run time — REFUSED at generation

- Confirmed in plain Lean 4.32.2 (no LemLib), binaries run with arguments
  so nothing folds: a 128-field structure of `Nat` exits 139, 127 prints;
  a 128-argument constructor exits 139; 127 `Nat` fields plus one `Bool`
  (1025 bytes) exits 139; 128 and 200 `Bool` fields (one byte each) print.
  So the limit is the object size: header plus pointer-sized fields past
  the runtime allocator's 1024-byte small-object limit. No sound workaround
  that keeps the record's semantics exists at the backend level.
- Fix: `lean_check_constructor_width` refuses a record or constructor with
  more than `lean_max_constructor_fields = 127` fields, counting every field
  at the pointer size (the upper bound), with a message naming the count,
  the limit, the crash and the remedy. Conservative by construction: it
  admits exactly the widths that cannot reach the limit and over-refuses a
  wide record of one-byte fields, loudly. The check runs from `def`'s
  `Type_def` arm (`lean_check_type_block`) so single records, which `def`
  dispatches straight to `type_def_record`, are covered (the first version
  sat in `type_def` and missed them; caught by the reproducer).
- Not a magic value: it mirrors a limit of the Lean runtime, not a choice
  about the semantics; the OCaml target is untouched.
- Tests: `negative/neg_record_width_128.lem`, `neg_variant_width_128.lem`;
  the 120-field constructor of `test_wide_patterns.lem` is the positive
  side.

### 7. (#7) `termination_argument … = automatic` on an `n - 1` recursion — NOT FIXED; DESIGN corrected

- Reproducer: `let rec cnt n = if n = 0 then 0 else 1 + cnt (n - 1)` with
  the declare → `def cnt (n : Nat) : Nat := lem_if n == 0 then 0 else 1 + cnt (n - 1)`
  → `fail to show termination … h✝ : ¬(n == 0) = true ⊢ n - 1 < n`.
- Measured, plain Lean 4.32.2: `if n = 0` (Prop) passes; `if (n == 0) = true`
  with core's `BEq` fails by default and passes with
  `decreasing_by all_goals simp_all; omega` (also `if h : …` + `simp at h;
  omega`). With LemLib imported the condition is
  `@BEq.beq Nat (@Lem_Basic_classes.instBEqOfEq0 Nat Lem_Num.instEq0Nat_1) n 0`
  (`#synth BEq Nat` → the bridge), and `simp_all`, `simp at h` and `omega`
  all fail: "No usable constraints found".
- Decision [AGENT]: no clean general fix exists on this side of the `BEq`
  bridge design pass (#2, "Design pass first", another agent). A
  `decreasing_by` script would have to unfold the bridge's instance chain
  per base type — a special path for one shape, tied to an instance design
  under revision. A generation-time refusal is not possible either (the
  backend cannot know which recursions Lean's checker will accept) and would
  break the consumers: Cerberus declares `automatic` on four structural
  list recursions (`utils.lem`), linksem on `unzip3`. The failure is a loud
  Lean build error, so nothing is silent. DESIGN's row and the manual no
  longer promise "total either way"; they state the limit, the measured
  cause and the remedy (`fuel`/`fuel_measure`/`structural`). TODO item 45
  carries the fix, sequenced after the bridge pass.

### 8. Fail-open spots from the code review — FIXED

- `type_def_indexed` `| _ ->` emitted an empty `inductive … Type 1 where`:
  now raises (`Te_abbrev` reaching it is an internal error, as in `tyexp`;
  `Te_opaque` was already matched earlier).
- `P_num_add` rendered `(name + k)` "invalid Lean but visible": now raises
  unless `St.rendering_comment` (library text behind a representation).
- `lean_cmp_prepass` `depth > 50 → default_all ()` silently
  over-approximated comparison binders (which changes a declaration's
  type): now the same loud refusal as its twin in
  `lean_tuple_inst_demands`.
- The W8 non-exhaustive match in the derived-size builder (`CSfn`
  missing): `CSbad | CSfn` now raise an internal error (`lean_size_shape`
  produces neither); the fork's only default-flag warning in
  `lean_backend.ml` is gone.
- `process_file.ml` ignored `Sys.command "mkdir -p"`: replaced by
  `Sys.mkdir` with parents, a failure a fatal error naming the directory.
  Test: suite phase `lean-outdir-refusal` (`-outdir Makefile/sub`, whose
  parent is a file). TODO item 37 closed.
- No test reaches the three internal-error raises (the inputs do not exist
  after pattern compilation / type-def dispatch / the size shape
  analysis); they are recorded here.

### 9. State fixes — DONE

- `lean_cmp_bounds` moved into `St` ([invocation] lifetime, like
  `reader_lifted`), reset by `reset_invocation`; `if_tail_counter`
  ([invocation]) and `current_type_block` ([file]) reset too, and the new
  `tyvar_renames` ([render]).
- `lean_analysis_prepass_all` now runs `lean_cmp_prepass`, in the order
  `lean_defs` uses, so a module typechecked but not emitted in an
  invocation contributes its comparison-binder demands.
- `reset_invocation` still has no caller (TODO item 6 is the threading
  work); unchanged.

### 10. (#1) `min`/`max` under a user `Ord` instance — REGISTERED as a ruled deviation

- Reproducer (noodle `p_user_ord_instance`): `min (T 1 0) (T 2 0)` is
  `(1, 0)` on OCaml and `(2, 0)` on Lean; everything else about the
  instance agrees.
- Cause: `library/basic_classes.lem` `defaultMax = maxByLessEqual (<=)`
  with ``declare ocaml target_rep function defaultMax = `max` `` (Stdlib's
  structural `max`); upstream report `doc/upstream-tray/11-default-max-min-structural-on-ocaml.md`.
- Ruling: [USER 2026-10-03] "Register as deviation". No OCaml
  representation is changed.
- Register: `parity/probes/p_user_ord_minmax.lem` (the instance's `<=`,
  `min`/`max` both ways, and the explicit `maxByLessEqual (<=)` /
  `minByLessEqual (<=)` lines that agree); `expected_failures.txt` class
  `ruled`, quoting the ruling; the OCaml pin records the deviating
  reference, the Lean pin lem's semantics. Rulings record: X5 addendum in
  `2026-09-03_exception-case-rulings.md`; DESIGN's deviation list.

## Plants (each test fails on the before-fix binary)

Before-fix binary: `Lem 2026-05-01` (a scratch build of `git archive
5dfcd25`, so no git hash in its version string), run with its own
`library/`, every run under `timeout 60`. Verbatim, from
`plants.log`/`plants-compile.log` of the scratch directory (paths shortened):

```
== (a) item 1: test_contextual_keywords.lem on base
  exit 1: File ".../test_contextual_keywords.lem", line 140, character 44:   Syntax error
== (b) new negative probes on base (accepted, or hung = plant)

Test_mutual_record_order.lean:259:26: error(lean.invalidField): Invalid field `hb_lo`: The environment does not contain `Nat.hb_lo`, so it is not possible to project the field `hb_lo` from an expression
```

Reading: (a) item 1 fails to parse before the fix. (b) five of the six new
negative probes are ACCEPTED before the fix (the suite's `lean-negative`
phase would report "FAIL (accepted)"); the sixth, the 128-argument
constructor, hangs in the old layout printer (its derived one-line output
is the item-5 shape), so before the fix it is neither refused nor
generated. (c) the wide-pattern test times out before the fix (the
`lean-wide-patterns` phase fails with exit 124). (e) before the fix the
`mkdir -p` failure is ignored and lem dies later on the temp-file rename
with `Sys_error`; the `lean-outdir-refusal` phase's grep for "cannot
create the output directory" fails. (d) the three extended positive tests
generate before the fix but their Lean does not compile: the bare `at`
field, the captured type variable, the unparenthesised update base. After
the fix every one of these is green in the suite run below. Item 10 is a
registration, not a fix: the probe's two pins are the before and after of
nothing; its plant is the suite's own rule that a registered probe which
PASSES fails the suite.

## Gates (verbatim tails)

All runs in the worktree, final binary (`lem -v`: see the suite's
`test_version` line), nothing rebuilt during a run (the first drift run
was invalidated by a concurrent rebuild — its fork side reported
`LEMROOT/lem: No such file or directory` — and re-run).

`scripts/ce make nonlean-regress` (tail, verbatim):
```

## Consumer trees

Both frozen consumers regenerated with the final `lem` of this branch and
compared with the trees generated by the unmodified `5dfcd25` binary from
the same inputs: Cerberus 170 files, linksem 194 files, **byte-identical**
(`diff -rq`: 0 differing files; `tokdiff.py`: identical). No census was
needed. This is expected: every change either refuses input that failed
today, renames or escapes only on collisions neither consumer has, or
(the layout printer) makes the same decisions faster.

## Left for the operator

- Item 7's general fix waits on the `BEq` bridge design pass (TODO 45/46).
- TODO 47: whether type-definition parameters should be renamed rather
  than refused, and whether to narrow the `below`/`brecOn` field refusal to
  recursive records.
- Package C (cleanup, no output change), including the walker
  consolidation the item-3 collector adds to (TODO 48).

## Provenance

[USER 2026-10-03]: the rulings quoted above. [AGENT] (this worker): every
measurement, the escape/refuse split of item 2, the rename/refuse split of
item 3, the primed fresh names, the reserved `lemRecBase`, the 127-field
limit as a count, the item-7 disposition, the tests and this record.

## Orchestrator verification of package A (2026-10-03)

The orchestrator re-ran the gates independently on `f33cf4f`, from the
frozen inputs (Cerberus `51a7402ce`, linksem `f54d119` source export):
```
base make exit 0 / arc make exit 0   [tree clean after make]

**Rulings since the slice began**, all [USER 2026-10-03]:
- #2 (the `BEq` bridge): "(a) 450/400 (Recommended)", landing as its "Own slice
  after A and C". Design note: branch `docs/beq-lattice-design`, `39c4e0c`.
  TODO 45 (`automatic` termination under the bridge) is retested in that
  slice.

**Attribution note.** "Agree, this is minor but lets get it right from now
on": `Co-Authored-By` trailers name the model that actually did the work.
- `f33cf4f` correctly says Claude Fable 5.1.
- The earlier Fable-written output-niceness commits `ac5565b`, `131b922` and
  `0885bf6` say Claude Opus 5.5, because the orchestrator's brief prescribed
  that line. They are merged and pushed, so they stay as they are; this note
  is the correction.

## Package C: cleanup, no output change (2026-10-03)

Ruling, verbatim [USER 2026-10-03]: "C: cleanup, no output change
(Recommended)". Worked on `arc/backend-hardening` from `a1fdf6e` (package A
verified). Every decision below not quoted as a ruling is [AGENT]. The
source is the code review of 2026-10-03 (`REPORT.md` §3–§7 and its notes);
every claim acted on was re-verified first (grep, build, or a run).

Commits: `a6c63aa` (1/4: dead code, the reserved-name table, the priority
constant, the debug variables), `35e893e` (2/4: LemLib deletions), `cff6663`
(3/4: comments and messages, the TODO 39 test), the commit that adds this section (4/4: TODO
register and this record). Gates ran on every commit's tree, with the lem
binary built from it (§"Gates" below).

### 1. Dead code (backend and the fork's shared-file edits)

Each deletion had zero callers over `src/`, `library/`, `tests/`,
`lean-lib/` (grep; counts are of hits other than the definition itself):

| Deleted | Evidence |
|---|---|
| `is_fuelled_cref` (`lean_backend.ml`) | 0 hits |
| `tv_reason` + `let _ = tv_reason`, `fallback_beq_ord`, `fallback_trio` and their "RETIRED" comments | both `fallback_*` were `emp` spliced into the instance output: 0 bytes of output; `tv_reason` read only by `let _` |
| `block`/`block_hov` no-op wrappers and their three call sites (`Fun`, `Set`, `Vector` renderers), plus the `is_user_exp` binding only they read | wrappers were `fun _ _ t -> t` (shadowing `Output.block`); unwrapped in place |
| `let _ = t in` (`derived_comparison_single`: the pattern variable is now `_`), `let _ = if … in` (now a statement) | no value read |
| `open Backend_common` | every use qualified (compiles without it) |
| `Output.flatten_newlines`, `flatten_newlines_in_comment` (`src/output.ml`, `.mli`) | fork-introduced (`git show 3802cb0:src/output.ml` has neither); the backend aliases `flatten_newlines_keep_comments` — 0 callers |

Not deleted: `St.reset_invocation` (no caller, but TODO item 6's threading
work is its home; unchanged since package A).

### 2. LemLib deletions (consumer-visible)

Read-only greps over all consumers — `cerberus-lean/lean_frontend/*.lean`
(49 files), `cerberus-sl` (12 301 `.lean` files outside `.lake`),
`linksem-lean/linksem/lean/{handwritten,driver}` — and over lem-lean itself
(`library/`, `tests/`, `lean-lib/`, `src/`). Counts are hits per consumer
(cerberus-lean / cerberus-sl / linksem):

| Deleted | Consumer hits | lem-lean hits |
|---|---|---|
| `natDiv`, `natMod` (silently total `a / b`, `a % b`) | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0 — `num.lem` points every rep at `lemNatDiv`/`lemNatMod` |
| `unsupportedRationalFromNumeral/FromInt/FromFrac`, `unsupportedRealFromNumeral/FromInt/FromFrac` (root duplicates of `LemUnsupported.*`) | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0 — `num.lem` uses the `LemUnsupported.` twins; the `*Less/LessEq/Greater/GreaterEq/Abs` wrappers stay (used by the generated `Num.lean`) |
| `lemBoolToProp` | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0 |
| `apply` | 53 / 209 / 0 — all the tactic `apply` or prose (filtered by hand; `function.lem:59` inlines lem's `apply` on Lean, so no generated code can reference the root def) | 0 |
| `listGet?`, `listGet!` | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0 (`listGetOpt`/`listGetBang` are the live pair, `list.lem:495`, `list_extra.lem:122`) |
| `listSet` (its comment "replaces removed List.set" was false: the body called `List.set`) | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0 |
| `setPartitionBy` | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0 (`set.lem` has no `partition` rep) |
| `Pmap.mem`, `maxBinding?`, `exists_`, `filter`/`filterAux`, `partition`/`partitionAux`, `compare`/`compareAux` | 0 / 0 / 0 (the consumers' `Pmap.` uses: `Empty`, `Node`, `find?`, `find`, `bindings(Aux)`, `add`, `map`, `fold`, `empty`, `CmpLaws`) | 0 outside their own recursion; `map.lem:233`'s `Pmap.mem` is the OCaml rep |
| `lemListMapiAux` and its theorem `lemListMapiAux_eq` (`LemLibTheorems.lean`) | 0 / 0 / 0 | only the theorem |

Also: the stale `LemLibPmapLaws.lean` comment that explained writing
`Ord.compare` to avoid `Pmap.compare` (gone). The regenerated
`lean-lib/LemLib/*.lean` are unchanged (they come from `library/*.lem`,
untouched).

Kept, deliberately: `lemNatLnot`/`lemNatLsr` (TODO item 33 is an operator
decision; `lemNatLsr` added to the row); `lemStringFromNatHelper`/
`NaturalHelper` and the `partial` `natSqrtAux` (TODO item 38: merging or
totalising changes a definition, not a deletion); the `OfNat` instances on
the unsupported types (review suspicion, unmeasured). Comments in
`library/*.lem` (jargon at `set.lem:350`, `relation.lem:629`, `map.lem:80`,
`word.lem:855`, `function.lem`'s wrong line number) were NOT touched: every
`.lem` comment is carried into the nine non-Lean outputs, so the change
would move `nonlean-regress`'s goldens and need a rebaseline — left for a
slice that rebaselines.

### 3. Comments

`src/lean_backend.ml`: 184 replacements (a scripted sweep, each old text
matched exactly once), plus `src/lean_layout.ml` (4), `src/parser.mly`
(3 comment/message sites), `lean-lib/LemLib.lean` (48, plus the `fmapUnionBy` binder),
`LemLibTest.lean` (8), `LemLibTheorems.lean` (3), `LemLibPmapLaws.lean`
(4), `lakefile.lean` (3), `lean-lib/README.md` (1). What changed: arc,
slice, charter, audit and finding tags (`arc-14 S2 B1 (be:G3)`, `linksem
2026-09-28 (B13)`, `parity-fix F5/F6`, `D2-enablers slice`), dates that
narrated history, the `A' witness: use2 100 (1,2) = 5` style of evidence,
the two `HISTORY` blocks of `LemLib.lean` (now one plain "no axiom, no
unsafe inhabitant" note naming what was removed and why), "verbatim port"
(the translations are not verbatim: NOTICE/DESIGN). Kept: every `[USER …]`
ruling quote and every pointer to a design note or to a record where a
ruling is the reason (`2026-08-22_arc14-instance-priority-lattice.md`,
`arc8-inhabited-threading-design.md`, `2026-09-05_measure-hypothesis-record.md`,
`2026-09-01_L2-deletion-record.md`, `2026-09-03_exception-case-rulings.md`),
and the mechanism comments the review named as the model.

Corrected claims: the stale "sorry" wording — the `lean_cmp_shape`
parameter `sorried` and the derivation's `sorried`/`sorried0` variables
are `residual`/`residual0` (the instances are loud `failwithI` residuals,
not `sorry`), and the comment for `lean_cmp_shape` now sits on its
function (it was separated from it by `lean_typ_has_fn`); "the proof is by
sorry anyway" (theorem marker), "sorry-based opaque type instances",
"skip sorry BEq/Ord instances", "sorried residual instances",
"sorry-based instances are useless" — all rewritten to what the code does.
The wrong claim at the `Infix` renderer ("this Infix path has NONE of the
reader/fuel hooks" while `fuel_scope_check` is called four lines below) now
says which checks run there (unsupported construct, supply, fuel scope,
reader_consumer) and which injection hooks are absent (reader arguments,
the fuel worker rewrite), and why a fuel'd constant still resolves (the
`[LemFuel]` binder is instance-implicit). The header's "BEq is derived for
types without function-typed constructor args" and "Block formatting is
disabled" rows describe the current derivation and layout passes.

### 4. User-facing messages

Rewritten to plain, actionable English; every negative probe's `EXPECT`
substring kept unless noted:

| Site | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `declare {lean} effectful` refusal | "deleted by the effect-retirement arc (charter: cerberus-lean lean_frontend/docs/2026-08-31_effect-retirement-design.md @64dd6efeb, section 7.1)" | "…crossed from BaseIO back into pure types through a library axiom, which is gone (doc/lean-backend/DESIGN.md, \"Zero axioms; effects as explicit state\")"; EXPECT `'declare {lean} effectful' is retired on the lean target` kept |
| FM-literal (numeral measure) | quoted the [USER 2026-09-03] ruling verbatim | "a literal fuel is a magic value, forbidden by design — doc/lean-backend/DESIGN.md, \"No magic values\""; EXPECT `FM-literal` kept |
| reserved-name capture | "(pre-merge audit 2026-09-05, probe p11b)"; listed five names | the names come from the table (now including `lemRecBase`); the cite is gone; EXPECTs `renders on Lean as \`lemFuel\` — a reserved synthesized binder name` / `\`lemTail\`` kept |
| reserved binder | listed the names inline | from the table (the same three names and two prefixes); EXPECTs kept |
| Type-1 comparison refusal | "(the historical sorry-bodied residual instances are deleted, arc-10 audit fix)" | "…in the Type 1 universe, where the comparison classes are not defined; escape hatches: …". `neg_type1_comparison.lem`'s EXPECT was the WHOLE old message; it is now the diagnosis `cannot derive BEq/Ord instances for type 't1': heterogeneous type-parameter counts put its mutual block in the Type 1 universe` (justification: the removed clause was the process history itself; the new substring still pins the reason and the type name) |
| `Te_opaque` internal error | "(opaque types are fail-closed, arc-8 S2)" | "internal error — … (opaque types are fail-closed)" |
| tuple-instance walk depth, confusable tuple-instance demand (×3), numeric type variable | "B14" | plain ("the tuple-instance walk", "local instance binding") |
| `let _ = e1`/`let () = e1` in a supply-threaded body | "(B15: e1 would be dropped; …)" | "(e1 would be dropped; …)" |
| `parser.mly` numeric fuel budget | "was removed (fuel-parameter arc, 2026-09-04) … [USER 2026-09-03] \"…\"" | "is not accepted: a per-declaration fuel literal is a magic value (doc/lean-backend/DESIGN.md, \"No magic values\") … Use the sentinel form"; EXPECT `numeric fuel-budget form` kept |
| `parser.mly` numeric fuel measure | quoted the ruling; suggested `` `sizeOf x` `` (which the backend refuses: FM-sizeOf) | cites DESIGN; suggests `` `List.length xs + 1` ``; EXPECT `a numeral is not a fuel measure` kept |

### 5. TODO register

- 39 closed: `is_lean_pat_direct` exists (`src/patterns.ml`), the path is
  reachable, and `tests/comprehensive/test_multiclause.lem` + the suite
  phase `lean-multiclause` pin the equation form (`def f : Nat → Nat | (0 :
  Nat) => 1 | (n : Nat) => n`, the cons form for `len2`) and the single
  `match` for a constructor-pattern group, with asserts for the values.
- 38 rewritten: four `partial def`s (the generated
  `Lem_Set_extra.leastFixedPointUnbounded` added; `natSqrtAux` marked
  avoidably partial), the helper duplication, and what package C deleted.
- 34 measured: 18 of 259 root-level declarations of `LemLib.lean` are in
  `lean_constants`, 241 absent (awk over the file, before the deletions;
  the review's "about 300" overstated it); `LemLib` itself is the exposed
  root of `supplySplit`.
- 36: (e) `initial_env.ml` and (f) `type_defs_rename_type` added, with the
  (b)↔(d) coupling.
- 33: `lemNatLsr` added, with why (`transform.lem` is not in `LIBS`).
- 3/4/6/29: line references re-derived by grep after the sweep; 4 lists
  the review's further name-keyed sites; 6 notes the callback fires on
  every target.

### 6. Debug variables

`LEM_INH_DEBUG`, `LEM_THREAD_DEBUG`, `LEM_LEAN_LAYOUT_DEBUG` are documented
in DESIGN ("Debugging the analyses": what each prints). The two backend
ones are read with `Sys.getenv_opt … <> None` like the layout one, so all
three mean "set to any value" (before, `LEM_INH_DEBUG=` — set but empty —
was off; a debug knob, no output effect).

### 7. Small duplications

- The reserved-name contract is one table (`lean_reserved_*` in
  `lean_backend.ml`, with `lean_starts_with`): the binder check, the
  capture check, `lemLetRhs_`, `_lemIfTail`, `lemSize`/`lemSize_aux` and the
  `lemTail`/`lemRecBase` literals read from it; the inline prefix-length
  literals (`11`, `10`) are gone. Behaviour: UNCHANGED. The five sites had
  not drifted by accident: the binder check deliberately omits `lemTail`,
  because the tail hoisting (`lean_hoist_tail_binders`, which runs first)
  synthesizes that binder into the very clause the check scans — the first
  attempt at a full union refused Cerberus's `are_compatible`
  (`ailTypesAux.lem:784`, "binder 'lemTail' collides…"). The table records
  the two populations (`lean_reserved_binder_names` ⊂
  `lean_reserved_exact_names`) and the reason. The capture check's message
  gained `lemRecBase`, which it checked but did not list.
- `(priority := 500)` at six sites is `lean_instance_kw_auto`
  (`lean_instance_auto_priority = 500`); the emitted text is byte-identical
  (consumer trees). The BEq-lattice slice changes one constant.
- `fmapUnionBy`'s unused comparator binder is `_cmp` (one LemLib build
  warning fewer; no term change).

### Gates (verbatim tails)

Reference trees: `.tmp/hardening/v-arc/` (package A's output from the
frozen inputs). Builds of `lem` are the worktree's; every Lean run through

### Provenance

[USER 2026-10-03]: the package ruling. [AGENT]: every deletion decision,
the reserved-name-table population split, the message wordings, the TODO
texts, the kept items and this record.

## Orchestrator verification of package C (2026-10-03)

The orchestrator re-ran the gates independently on `1ecf93f`, from the same
frozen inputs:
```
arc make exit 0   [tree clean after make]
cerb: 0 differing files / linksem: 0 differing files   [vs 5dfcd25's lem]
lemlib exit 0  (Build completed successfully (39 jobs).)
=== Generation: 73 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped ===
  OK: equation form for f and len2, match form for g
Build completed successfully (208 jobs).
parity: 49 probes: 38 OK, 11 XFAIL (registered, Lean side pinned), 0 FAIL
nonlean-regress: OK (893 artifact rows, 216 exit rows, 9 emitters, byte-identical to golden)
upstream-drift: 944 upstream files; 198 differ   [library code rows all comments/whitespace only; cerberus-ocaml / linksem-ocaml absent]
```
Deleted LemLib definitions: a spot check of `natDiv`, `natMod`,
`lemBoolToProp`, `listGet?`, `listGet!`, `setPartitionBy`, `lemListMapiAux`
and `unsupportedNatFrom` finds no use in hand-written consumer Lean
(Cerberus `lean_frontend/*.lean`, cerberus-sl, linksem handwritten/driver).
The same names, plus `listSet` and the `Pmap` mirrors, have no use in the
regenerated consumer trees either.

## BEq-lattice slice: the `[Eq0 a] : BEq a` bridge below core (2026-10-03)

Rulings, verbatim [USER 2026-10-03]: "(a) 450/400 (Recommended)" and
"Own slice after A and C". The design pass it lands is
[`2026-10-03_beq-instance-lattice-design.md`](2026-10-03_beq-instance-lattice-design.md)
(code-review finding L1, TODO item 46). Worked on `arc/backend-hardening`
from `8666b7f` (packages A and C verified). Every decision below that is
not one of the rulings is [AGENT]. Lean 4.32.2; every Lean run through
`cerberus-lean/scripts/capped`; consumer inputs frozen as in packages A
and C (Cerberus `51a7402ce`, linksem `f54d119`); scratch under
`.tmp/hardening/beq/` (ephemeral, deleted at slice end).

### 1. The change

`src/lean_backend.ml`: the one priority constant of package C became a
three-row table beside the lattice comment — `lean_instance_auto_priority
= 500` (unchanged), `lean_instance_eq0_bridge_priority = 450`,
`lean_instance_comparator_bridge_priority = 400` — with one keyword
builder `lean_instance_kw`. The class emitter's two bridge sites use the
two new rows: the `[Eq0 a] : BEq a` bridge, which was emitted with no
priority (Lean's default 1000), and the comparator-derived
`[SetType a]`/`[MapKeyType a] : BEq a` bridges, which were at the auto
slot. `make` regenerated the library; `git diff lean-lib/` is exactly the
three priority lines (verbatim):

```
-instance { a : Type } [Eq0 a] : BEq a where
+instance (priority := 450) { a : Type } [Eq0 a] : BEq a where
-instance (priority := 500) { a : Type } [SetType a] : BEq a where
+instance (priority := 400) { a : Type } [SetType a] : BEq a where
-instance (priority := 500) { a : Type } [MapKeyType a] : BEq a where
+instance (priority := 400) { a : Type } [MapKeyType a] : BEq a where
```

(`Basic_classes.lean:32`, `:184`; `Map.lean:55`.) Both consumer trees
regenerated with the changed `lem` are byte-identical to the trees from
`8666b7f`'s `lem` (`diff -rq`: `cerb: 0 differing files`, `linksem: 0
differing files`; 170 and 194 files).

### 2. The lattice, measured before and after

Against LemLib at `8666b7f` (`#synth`, `pp.explicit`), verbatim:

```
@instBEqOfEq0 Nat Lem_Num.instEq0Nat_1
@instBEqOfEq0 Int Lem_Num.instEq0Int_1
@instBEqOfEq0 String instEq0String
@instBEqOfEq0 Char instEq0Char
@instBEqOfEq0 Bool instEq0Bool
@instBEqOfEq0 Unit instEq0Unit
@Lem_Map.instBEqOfMapKeyType Int8 (@Lem_Map.instMapKeyTypeOfSetType Int8 (@instSetTypeOfOrd Int8 Int8.instOrd))
@instBEqOfEq0 Int32 Lem_Num.instEq0Int32
@instBEqOfEq0 Int64 Lem_Num.instEq0Int64
@Lem_Map.instBEqOfMapKeyType UInt64 (@Lem_Map.instMapKeyTypeOfSetType UInt64 (@instSetTypeOfOrd UInt64 UInt64.instOrd))
instBEqLemOrdering
Lem_Word.instBEqBitSequence
@List.instBEq Nat (@instBEqOfEq0 Nat Lem_Num.instEq0Nat_1)
ProbeOld.lean:57:0: error: failed to synthesize
  @LawfulBEq Nat (@instBEqOfEq0 Nat Lem_Num.instEq0Nat_1)
```

The Eq0 bridge won at Nat, Int, String, Char, Bool, Unit, Int32, Int64; the
comparator bridge (`instBEqOfMapKeyType`, the newer of the two tied with
core at 500) won at Int8, Int16, ISize, UInt8, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64,
USize, `BitVec n` and core's `Ordering`. Derived (`LemOrdering`,
`bitSequence`) and specific (`List`, `Option`, `Prod`, `Pset`, `Fmap`,
`Sum`) instances were not displaced, only their base-type arguments. The
old base `Eq0` bodies, verbatim `#print` (the Int, Int32, Int64, String,
Char and Bool instances have the same shape over their `Ord`):

```
def Lem_Num.instEq0Nat : Eq0 Nat :=
@Eq0.mk Nat (fun x y => @BEq.beq Nat (@instBEqOfSetType Nat (@instSetTypeOfOrd Nat instOrdNat)) x y) …
def Lem_Num.instEq0Nat_1 : Eq0 Nat :=
@Eq0.mk Nat (fun x y => @BEq.beq Nat (@instBEqOfEq0 Nat Lem_Num.instEq0Nat) x y) …
def instEq0Unit : Eq0 Unit :=
@Eq0.mk Unit (fun x x_1 => true) fun x x_1 => false
```

After the change every one of those seventeen types resolves to
`@instBEqOfDecidableEq T instDecidableEqT` (verbatim for the three the
probe names: `instBEqOfDecidableEq` ×3; `LawfulBEq`: `Nat.instLawfulBEq`,
`instLawfulBEqString`, `@instLawfulBEq UInt64 instDecidableEqUInt64`), the
base `Eq0` bodies re-elaborate to core
(`instEq0Nat_1 := @Eq0.mk Nat (fun x y => @BEq.beq Nat (@instBEqOfDecidableEq Nat instDecidableEqNat) x y) …`),
and `@instBEqOfEq0 Nat Lem_Num.instEq0Nat_1 = instBEqOfDecidableEq` holds by
`rfl` at all seven Eq0-route types. `Std.LawfulEqOrd` exists in core for
every switched type except `Unit` (LemLib's own `instOrdUnit_lemLib`) and
`Ordering`.

### 3. Probes, plant-tested

`tests/comprehensive/lean-test/TestInstancePriorityCheck.lean` gained legs
5 and 6: `#guard_msgs in #synth BEq Nat/String/UInt64` expecting
`instBEqOfDecidableEq`; `LawfulBEq` at the three types by `inferInstance`;
the operator's example `(a b : Nat) (h : (a == b) = true) : a = b := by simpa
using h` (and at `String`); `(a == b) = decide (a = b) := rfl` at `Int`; a
model-only inductive still resolving to `instBEqOfEq0`; polymorphic
`[Eq0 a] [SetType a]` code resolving to the Eq0 bridge (`rfl` against
`isEqual`). Legs 1–4 are unchanged. The plant compiled the file with the
generated `Test_instance_priority` against the `8666b7f` LemLib in a scratch
Lake project; every leg-5 line fails, legs 1–4 and 6 pass (verbatim, the
nine errors):

```

The same project against the changed LemLib: `Build completed successfully
(36 jobs).` These legs are speedbumps on the elaboration property; the
trust property, value parity, is §4.

### 4. Agreement theorems (`lean-lib/LemLibTheorems.lean`, namespace `BeqLattice`)

For every type whose winner switched, a kernel theorem states the OLD
instance term — spelled out, since it no longer wins resolution — equal to
the NEW one. `cmpBEq_eq_decide` (`[Ord α] [Std.LawfulEqOrd α] [DecidableEq α]`:
the comparator route `match defaultCompare a b with | .EQ => true | _ =>
false` equals `decide (a = b)`) and its two instance-form corollaries
`setTypeBridge_eq_core` (the Eq0 route's old body:
`@instBEqOfSetType α (@instSetTypeOfOrd α _)`) and `mapKeyBridge_eq_core`
(`@instBEqOfMapKeyType α (@instMapKeyTypeOfSetType α (@instSetTypeOfOrd α _))`);
then per type, with the instance names as `#print`/`#synth` gave them:
`nat_old_eq_new`, `int_`, `string_`, `char_`, `bool_`, `int32_`,
`int64_old_eq_new` (Eq0 route), `unit_old_eq_new` (old body `true`, by
cases), `int8_`, `int16_`, `isize_`, `uint8_`, `uint16_`, `uint32_`,
`uint64_`, `usize_`, `bitVec_old_eq_new` (`∀ n`) and `ordering_old_eq_new`
(by cases; core has no `LawfulEqOrd Ordering`) for the comparator route. The
new state is pinned by `rfl`: `isEqual_nat`/`_nat_1`/`_int`/`_int_1`/
`_int32`/`_int64`/`_string`/`_char`/`_bool` (`Eq0.isEqual a b = decide (a =
b)`), `isEqual_unit` (by cases) and `bridge_<T>_is_core`
(`@instBEqOfEq0 T instEq0T = instBEqOfDecidableEq`) for the seven Eq0-route
types. `#print axioms` (build log, verbatim shape): `cmpBEq_eq_decide`,
`setTypeBridge_eq_core`, `mapKeyBridge_eq_core`, `bool_old_eq_new`,
`ordering_old_eq_new` depend on `[propext]`; `unit_old_eq_new` and
`isEqual_unit` on none; every other `*_old_eq_new` on `[propext,
Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (through core's `LawfulEqOrd` instances). No
`native_decide`, `bv_decide`, `ofReduce*`, `decide`, `sorry`.

Coverage of the census pairs (§5): every `(Nat, Lem_Num.instEq0Nat_1)` site
and its abbreviations (`aid`, `thread_id`, `thread_id0`, `allocation_id`,
`loop_id`, `tid`, `reg`, `scope_id`, `provenance_id`; linksem `cfa_*`,
`address_expr_fn_ref`) → `nat_old_eq_new`; `(Int, instEq0Int_1)` and
`CerbMem.StorageInstanceId`/`Address`/`SymbolicStorageInstanceId`,
`cfa_sfoffset`, `integer_value_base` → `int_old_eq_new`; `(String,
instEq0String)`, `sym`, `cabs_identifier` → `string_old_eq_new`; Bool, Char,
Int32, Int64 → their theorems; `(Unit, instEq0Unit)` and
`sdt_unspecified_parameter` → `unit_old_eq_new`; UInt8/UInt32/UInt64 and
`Ordering` comparator sites → `uint*_old_eq_new`, `ordering_old_eq_new`. The
two consumer-model pairs: Cerberus `(String, instEq0String_symbol)`, body
`@BEq.beq Int (@instBEqOfEq0 Int Lem_Num.instEq0Int_1) (digest_compare x y) 0`
(verbatim `#print`), is `int_old_eq_new` at its one `==` plus Cerberus's own
`CerbCtypeMeasure.digest_compare_eq_zero_iff`, which rebuilt green in the
after-census; linksem's `(Nat | uint32 | uint64, instEq0Uint64_elf_types_native_uint_2)`
and the nine other `instEq0Uint{32,64}_elf_types_native_uint*` are a chain of
`isEqual := fun x y => x == y` bodies (verbatim `#print`: `_2 → Uint32 _6 →
_5 → Uint64 _1 → Uint32 _4 → _3 → _2 → Uint64 → Uint32 _1 → Uint32 →
Lem_Num.instEq0Nat_1`), so every one is `nat_old_eq_new`. In linksem even
plain `Nat` resolved to that model instance (`#synth BEq Nat ⟶
@instBEqOfEq0 Nat instEq0Uint64_elf_types_native_uint_2`: `uint64` is a
reducible abbreviation of `Nat`); it is core now.

### 5. Census

Instrument: `Census3.lean` (scratch; Census2 plus instance normalisation and
site records). For every constant of the consumer modules it records the
type/value hashes, the same hashes after replacing every application of
`instBEqOfEq0`, `instBEqOfSetType`, `instBEqOfMapKeyType` or
`instBEqOfDecidableEq` by one marker (hygienic names canonicalised by the
NORMALISED hashes, so a helper whose only change is the switch keeps its
name), the binder signature, safety, reducibility hints and status,
instance/projection/inline/extern/matcher flags, and one `SITE` row per
instance application. A declaration is EXPLAINED when its raw hashes moved
and its normalised hashes did not. Both consumers were built from scratch
copies (Cerberus's `lean_frontend` with the frozen generated tree and the 49
hand-written files of `51a7402ce`; linksem's `lean/` with the frozen
generated tree, `gen-roots.sh` re-run), with the LemLib dependency pointed by
path first at a `git archive 8666b7f lean-lib` copy, then at this worktree's
`lean-lib`.

**Cerberus** (218 `CerberusLean` roots; before 22:26:32–22:29:24 and after
22:44:47–22:45:06, `Build completed successfully (252 jobs).` both; the
after-build with the §6 patch). Verbatim census tails:
`census3: 34087 constants in 218 modules (146 hygienic, 3 rounds, 2587 instance sites)`
before, `34083 constants … 2587 instance sites` after (122 identical hygienic
twins collapse to one canonical name in each; 33965/33961 distinct). Derived
comparison: 33961 common; 4 only-before (the old `natEq0_iff` proof's
`match_1`, `_sparseCasesOn_1`, `_proof_1_4`, `_proof_1_5`); **675
declarations changed** (590 `def`, 82 `thm` — statements only, proofs
unmoved — 1 `opaque` `CabsImport.positionFiles`, the private `CoreParser.ScanSt`
constructor and recursor, whose types mention `==` at `UInt64`); **675
explained, 0 not**; 493 in generated modules, 182 in hand-written ones
(`CerbMem` 53, `CoreParser` 42, `Core_aux_lemMeasureProofs` 28, the other
measure-proof modules, `CabsImport` 8, …; all compiled unchanged except §6);
0 in `_auxiliary` modules. 1971 further declarations differ only in their
reducibility-hint height (`h=regN`), the expected consequence of a different
instance in the dependency cone. The 2448 instance sites inside the changed
declarations are all `instBEqOfDecidableEq` after; the 44 polymorphic bridge
sites (type a bound variable) are unchanged; no bridge site at a named type
remains. Switched pairs (sites / declarations, derived):

```
  859 / 335  instBEqOfEq0 @ Nat / Lem_Num.instEq0Nat_1
  753 / 232  instBEqOfEq0 @ Int / Lem_Num.instEq0Int_1

```

**linksem** (97 generated + 97 `_auxiliary` + 7 hand-written modules; before
22:31:51–22:32:18, after 22:45:50–22:46:07, `Build completed successfully
(324 jobs).` for `Linksem LinksemAux HandwrittenTest main_link`). Verbatim:
`census3: 12074 constants in 201 modules (8 hygienic, 3 rounds, 3972 instance sites)`
before and after (12070 distinct). **596 declarations changed, all `def`,
596 explained, 0 not**; 5 in hand-written modules
(`Byte_sequence_wrapper.find_byte.go` and its `_f`/`_sunfold`/`_unsafe_rec`,
`Byte_sequence_wrapper.instBEqByte_sequence`, `Filesystem_wrapper.is_abs_path`),
0 in `_auxiliary`; 839 height-only hint changes; 3923 after-sites all core.
Pairs: `(Nat, instEq0Uint64_elf_types_native_uint_2)` 3010 / 409, `(String,
instEq0String)` 256 / 107, `(uint32, …_2)` 193 / 65, `(Nat, instEq0Nat_1)`
140 / 32, Char 90 / 12, `(uint64, …_2)` 51 / 19, Bool 51 / 24, Int 27 / 21,

`sdt_unspecified_parameter` (Unit) 3 / 3, Int32 2 / 2, Int64 2 / 2, the nine
other `instEq0Uint*` chain members 2 / 1 each, `Ordering` (comparator, in
`instBEqByte_sequence`) 1 / 1.

The design note's estimates (about 903 and 736) were sums over rows in
which a declaration can appear more than once; the distinct counts are 675
and 596. `LinksemAux` (the model's executable assertions) and Cerberus's
`_auxiliary` modules built green on both sides: no asserted value moved.

### 6. Cerberus: the hand-written proofs

The unpatched after-build failed at exactly one place (verbatim):

```
error: generated/CerbCtypeMeasure.lean:342:2: 'show' tactic failed, pattern
  (match defaultCompare n1 n2 with
      | LemOrdering.EQ => true
      | x => false) =
      true ↔
    n1 = n2
is not definitionally equal to target
  Lem_Basic_classes.isEqual n1 n2 = true ↔ n1 = n2
```

`natEq0_iff` now reads `show (n1 == n2) = true ↔ n1 = n2; exact beq_iff_eq`
(its docstring updated); `symEq_iff` (`:351`) re-elaborates unchanged and
keeps using it. The patch is
[`2026-10-03_beq-lattice-cerberus-repin.patch`](2026-10-03_beq-lattice-cerberus-repin.patch);
`git apply --check` passes against both the frozen `51a7402ce` and the
mainline head `d6c548847` (nothing applied — the Cerberus re-pin waits for
its `_Alignas` and union-twin slices). With it the library built green; no
other hand-written file broke (the 182 hand-written declarations whose
terms moved all compiled). Not run here, for the re-pin: the full battery
per `scripts/LADDER.md`/VALIDATION.md cache-disabled, `check_failure_reach.sh`
(the kernel closures of `defaultCompare`/`instBEqOfSetType` leave many
declarations; neither contains a failure site), the axiom gate.

linksem: the hand-written tree needs no change. The default `lake build`
of the scratch copy failed only in `driver/MainElf.lean:32:45: Unknown
identifier `usage_text`` (and `:44:45`) on BOTH LemLibs — the primary's
driver is ahead of the frozen `f54d119` model, a frozen-input skew, not
this slice — so the after-build targeted `Linksem LinksemAux HandwrittenTest
main_link`.

### 7. TODO 45 retest (`automatic` on `n - 1` under `lem_if`)

Reproducer `let rec cnt (n : nat) : nat = if n = 0 then 0 else 1 + cnt (n - 1)`
with `declare {lean} termination_argument cnt = automatic`, generated by the
changed `lem` (`def cnt (n : Nat) : Nat := lem_if n == 0 then 0 else 1 + cnt
(n - 1)`) and compiled against the changed LemLib — still fails (verbatim):

```
error: Test_todo45.lean:17:4: fail to show termination for
  cnt
…
n : Nat
h✝ : ¬(n == 0) = true
⊢ n - 1 < n
```

Plain Lean 4.32.2 with core's `BEq` and no LemLib gives the same failure
(`T1`), so the default `decreasing_tactic` does not use the hypothesis even
when `==` is core's. What the slice changes: the same module with
`decreasing_by all_goals simp_all; omega` appended now builds (`Build
completed successfully (34 jobs).`), where the record's item 7 measured
`simp_all`/`omega` failing on the bridge. NOT closed: the remaining fix is a
design choice — an emitted `decreasing_by` forces well-founded recursion on
every `automatic` declaration (Cerberus's four list recursions, linksem's
`unzip3`), so it is for the operator; TODO item 45 carries the options,
DESIGN's row states the measured limit. No regression test was added.

### 8. cerberus-sl re-pin note (draft; read-only analysis at `12d247c`, no build)

Nine hand-written lemmas spell out the bridge and break or stop matching
(each becomes a core lemma):

| Site | Today | Replacement |
|---|---|---|
| `CerberusIris/Env.lean:30` `lemNatBeq_iff` | statement names `@instBEqOfEq0 Nat Lem_Num.instEq0Nat_1`; proof `show (match defaultCompare a b …)` — BREAKS | restate as `(a == b) = true ↔ a = b`, proof `beq_iff_eq` |
| `Env.lean:38` `lemNatBeq_eq_decide` | statement names the bridge; proof via `lemNatBeq_iff` | restate as `(a == b) = decide (a = b) := rfl` (uses: `Env.lean:59`, `EvalSubst.lean:47,64`, `SubstE.lean:34`) |
| `Lang.lean:177` `lem_nat_beq_iff` | `change (match setElemCompare …)` — BREAKS | `beq_iff_eq` (uses: `Env.lean:523`, `RoundCtrl.lean:1716`, `SelectBridge.lean:120,125`, `RulesS.lean:2266-2340`) |
| `EvalArms.lean:1597` `lem_int_beq_iff` | same shape — BREAKS | `beq_iff_eq` (uses: `EvalArms.lean:1686`, `HeapModelAlloc.lean:65`, `HeapModelKill.lean:59,66,108`, `HeapPtrEq.lean:127`, `Memory/Carrier.lean:223`, `PtrEqModel.lean:87`, `PureEvalS.lean:650,652,717`) |
| `Repr.lean:30` `int_beq_refl` | `show (match defaultCompare x x …)` — BREAKS | `beq_self_eq_true` (uses: `Repr.lean:209,831`, `HeapModelKill.lean:30,115`, `Memory/Carrier.lean:245`, `Memory/Transitions.lean:56,61`, `Memory/Unspecified.lean:36`, `PtrEqModel.lean:68`, `CerberusSL/IdiomsCall.lean:1664`, `InterfaceS.lean:1720,1761`) |
| `Repr.lean:411` `lem_nat_beq_self` | statement names the bridge; `change` — BREAKS | `beq_self_eq_true` (uses: `Repr.lean:418,419,422`, `Memory/Unspecified.lean:59,61`, `CerberusSL/StdLibEq.lean:290,708`) |
| `Call.lean:182` (inside `call_proc_eq`) | `change (match setElemCompare params.length params.length …)` — BREAKS | `beq_self_eq_true _` or `simp` |
| `CerberusSL/StdLibEq.lean:33` `lem_nat_beq_self` | re-export whose statement names the bridge | restate with `==` |
| `CerberusSL/RulesS.lean:2266` `lem_nat_beq_iff` | re-export, statement already `==` | unchanged (follows `Lang`) |

60 grep hits for the six lemma names outside `.lake`/`.cerberus-ws`/the quoted
corpus (definitions, re-exports, comments and uses together; the note's "about
64" was at `6edb0c4`). Under the new LemLib the two statements that name the
bridge still typecheck (`bridge_nat_is_core` is `rfl`) but no longer match the
generated `==` syntactically, so `rw`/`simp only` with them would stop firing:
restate them. Two `simp only [… beq_iff_eq]` calls were inert on the bridge
and will fire: `Recon/Admit.lean:742` (`simp only [runOK, Bool.and_eq_true,
beq_iff_eq] at this`, after which `obtain ⟨hl, hlen⟩ := this` and the `match
lp, hlen` see `… = …` instead of `(… == …) = true`) and `Recon/Arena.lean:393`
(`simp only [d11Call, Bool.or_eq_true, Bool.and_eq_true, beq_iff_eq]`, then
`rcases h2 with …`); `Env.lean:26` `digest_compare_eq` uses the same simp set
and is to be re-checked. `Repr.lean:831` already hedges both forms.
Unaffected: the `fmapAddBy defaultCompare …` terms in `DriverLoop.lean`,
`RunBuild.lean` (comparator values, not `==`). The 762/55/3 `decide` closers
are on concrete facts. A full cerberus-sl build follows its re-pin.

### 9. Docs

Lattice note: the 2026-10-03 addendum (core's 500 row, the 450/400 rows,
the undocumented tie, deliberate tie 1 retired, the specificity rule, the
extended invariant and probe). DESIGN.md: "Instance priorities come from one
table" and the `termination_argument … = automatic` row; the manual
chapter's two matching paragraphs. TODO.md: 46 closed, 45 re-measured,
line references re-derived. RECORDS.md: this section and the design note
indexed.

### Gates (verbatim tails)

every other line is verbatim. Run twice — 22:49–22:58 and, after the two
probe-comment edits of §3, 22:58–23:06 on the final sources — with
identical verdicts; the 15 lines containing "error" are the 14 parity
probes' "ocaml: failed as expected" lines and the negative-probes banner.
The "FAIL:" lines the parity runner prints inside the registered XFAIL
probes are its own reporting of the pinned Lean side.)

`make` leaves the tree clean apart from the intended changes (`git status`
at commit time: the eleven modified files and the patch file listed under
"Files"; the suite's `tests/comprehensive/invariance/_out/` is removed by
the phase that creates it).

every measurement, the three-row constant table, the theorem statements and
the decision to spell the old instance terms out, the probe legs, the census

## Orchestrator verification of the BEq-lattice slice (2026-10-03)

The orchestrator re-ran the gates independently on `e87056f`, from the same
frozen inputs:
```
arc make exit 0   [tree clean after make]
cerb: 0 differing files / linksem: 0 differing files   [generated text vs 5dfcd25's lem]
lemlib exit 0  (Build completed successfully (39 jobs).)
=== Generation: 73 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped ===
Build completed successfully (208 jobs).
parity: 49 probes: 38 OK, 11 XFAIL (registered, Lean side pinned), 0 FAIL
nonlean-regress: OK (893 artifact rows, 216 exit rows, 9 emitters, byte-identical to golden)
upstream-drift: 944 upstream files; 198 differ   [library code rows all comments/whitespace only; cerberus-ocaml / linksem-ocaml absent]
```
Direct probes against the new LemLib:
- `#synth BEq Nat` and `#synth BEq String` both give `instBEqOfDecidableEq`.
- The operator's `example (a b : Nat) (h : (a == b) = true) : a = b := by simpa using h` compiles.
- `#print axioms` on `BeqLattice.nat_old_eq_new`, `string_old_eq_new` and `bitVec_old_eq_new` gives `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`; on `ordering_old_eq_new` it gives `[propext]`.
- With `pp.explicit`, `nat_old_eq_new` states
  `@BEq.beq Nat (@instBEqOfSetType Nat (@instSetTypeOfOrd Nat instOrdNat)) a b = @BEq.beq Nat (@instBEqOfDecidableEq Nat instDecidableEqNat) a b`.
  So it relates the old bridge instance to core's, and is not a vacuous `x = x`.
- The orchestrator did not re-run the declaration census (675 Cerberus / 596
  linksem changes, all explained). It is the pre-merge audit's to
  re-derive.
