# The Lean backend for Lem

**Checked 2026-09-24:** source implementation at `1235498fa300c79504684a3bf774b902bc3b7458`;
[cleanup evidence](2026-09-24_public-readiness-remediation.md). This is an
early experimental backend, not a general correctness proof.

This fork adds a **Lean 4 backend** to [Lem](https://github.com/rems-project/lem):
`lem -lean` compiles Lem definitions to Lean 4 source that builds
against the [LemLib runtime](../../lean-lib/). It was built to port
the [Cerberus](https://github.com/rems-project/cerberus) C semantics
to Lean — the same Lem model that generates Cerberus's OCaml
implementation now also generates a Lean implementation — but it is a
general Lem backend, exercised by its own test suite independently of
Cerberus.

**Provenance.** The Lean backend was developed primarily by AI agents
(Claude, Anthropic) operating under the direction and review of a
human operator (Mike Dodds). Upstream Lem is by its own authors (see
the [top-level README](../../README.md)); the dated design records in
[`doc/notes/`](../notes/) are the working history of the backend.

Who this is for:

- You have a Lem specification and want an **executable Lean 4
  version** of it.
- You want the generated code to be **reasoned about in Lean** —
  the backend's design choices (below) exist to keep generated code
  proof-friendly.
- You want to understand **how the backend works** — see
  [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## Quickstart

Use this fork explicitly: the upstream opam release does not contain the
Lean backend. The measured platform is Linux x86_64; other platforms are
unverified. Prerequisites are Git, Bash, GNU make/coreutils/diffutils,
a C toolchain, opam 2, and elan with the toolchain in `lean-lib/lean-toolchain` installed. The local
measurement used OCaml 5.4.0, opam 2.1.5 and Lean 4.28.0; Cerberus uses
Lean 4.32.2. Package constraints are in `opam`. Public repository/ref
availability and a fresh dependency download remain operator checks in
the cleanup evidence; offline tests used preinstalled dependencies.

If opam has not been initialized, run `opam init --bare --no-setup` once
before the following commands.

```bash
git clone --branch mdd/lean-backend https://github.com/OathTech/lem-lean.git
cd lem-lean
opam switch create . ocaml-base-compiler.5.4.0 --no-switch --no-install
opam pin add --switch=. lem . --yes
opam exec --switch=. -- make
opam exec --switch=. -- make lean-libs

# Generate, compile, and evaluate a small client against this same LemLib.

opam exec --switch=. -- make -C tests/comprehensive lean
opam exec --switch=. -- make nonlean-regress
```

`scripts/capped` is repository-local; the comprehensive suite uses it by
default. `CAPPED=/path/to/wrapper` overrides the suite runner. The wrapper
uses Linux cgroup v2, then a systemd user service. If direct cgroup setup
fails and `systemd-run` is absent, it warns and runs uncapped. If
`systemd-run` exists but its user service is unavailable, the command fails. `CERB_MEM_MAX=32G` sets
the cap on a suitably provisioned machine; it is an upper limit, not a
minimum RAM requirement. Set `LEAN_ABORT_ON_PANIC=1` when executing native
clients that must stop on a reached panic. This does not prevent Lean
from eliminating an unused pure failure (see the limitations below).

The [manual](../manual/backend_lean.md) describes the language and a
reusable Lake setup. Issues about the fork's Lean backend belong in
[OathTech/lem-lean issues](https://github.com/OathTech/lem-lean/issues);
include the commit, toolchain, minimal `.lem` source and exact command.

## What you can rely on about the output

- **One model, two implementations.** The same Lem source generates
  both the OCaml and the Lean code, so differences can be investigated against shared source. Known
  differences and deliberate numeric exceptions are listed below. (Further differential
  evidence lives downstream: the cerberus-lean project runs its generated-Lean
  semantics differentially against the OCaml implementation across
  thousands-of-programs corpora — see that repository's
  `lean_frontend/VALIDATION.md` for what is compared, against what,
  and what its gates guarantee, and its `lean_frontend/DESIGN.md`.)
- **No inserted live proof holes or unsafe casts.** Bare `sorry` target
  representations are refused at generation time, including unused
  declarations and parameterized representations. Unsupported constructs
  are rejected or receive an explicit `failwithI` failure. Raw Lean
  snippets and hand-written implementations remain trusted inputs:
  generation is not a Lean parser or an axiom audit of arbitrary text.
  Compile and audit the actual downstream dependency cone.
- **Totality on demand; the fuel is yours.** By default, recursive
  Lem functions emit as Lean `partial def` (executable, but opaque to
  the kernel). A recursion that is structural on its data is marked
  `declare {lean} structural val f` and emits an ordinary `def` with
  `termination_by structural <param>` — Lean proves termination, the
  well-founded fallback is forbidden, and the kernel computes through
  it (`decide`/`rfl` on closed terms). Anything else is marked
  ``declare {lean} fuel val f = `sentinel` ``, which emits a total worker
  that recurses structurally on an
  explicit fuel counter, plus a wrapper `f [LemFuel] := f_lemFuel
  LemFuel.fuel` that starts the counter from the AMBIENT fuel — a
  parameter of the generated code (an instance-implicit `[LemFuel]`
  binder on `f` and on everything that reaches it), never a numeral:
  no default exists in the library or the output; the entry point
  chooses (`@f ⟨n⟩ …`), a theorem quantifies (`∀ [LemFuel]`), and
  `f_lemFuel_zero` states the exhaustion case by `rfl`. The backtick
  payload is the expression returned when the counter runs out; write
  it as `fuelExhausted <witness>` to make exhaustion a loud panic. A
  fuel'd function whose recursion is bounded by its data (but not in the
  structural checker's shape) adds ``declare {lean} fuel_measure val f =
  `List.length xs + 1` ``: the wrapper starts the counter from that
  computable measure of the arguments (`def f (xs : …) := f_lemFuel
  (<measure>) xs`), so `f` is fuel-free for its callers and the kernel
  computes through it; the backend emits the per-function sufficiency
  obligation (`f_measure_sufficient`: worker = wrapper at every fuel at
  or above the measure) whose proof you write in
  `<Module>_lemMeasureProofs.lean` — a missing or mistyped theorem fails
  the build, and a `sorry` fails the suite's token gate. When the measure
  is sufficient only on well-formed inputs (an acyclic tag environment, a
  basis `2 ≤ b`), add ``assuming `H` `` — a Lean Prop over the same
  parameters: the wrapper is unchanged, the obligation gains `H` as the
  binder `lemHyp` right before `lemFuel` (`H → μ ≤ fuel → worker =
  wrapper`), and outside `H` the wrapper may exhaust — loudly. The measure may
  be the backend-DERIVED structural size of an argument's type (`lemSize
  x`): every recursive block of generated inductives gets a computable
  `t.lemSize : t → Nat` in its own module, so a function recursing on a
  type defined beside it (an `Eq` instance's equality, say) is measurable
  without any hand-written Lean. A definition whose head binds fewer
  parameters than its type has arrows (a trailing lambda in the clause
  body — typically a trailing `function`: `let rec f acc = function | []
  -> … | x :: xs -> f … xs`, whose recursion argument is the anonymous
  scrutinee) is NOT rewritten in the `.lem`: when it carries
  `fuel_measure` or `structural`, the Lean emission alone hoists EVERY
  trailing variable-binder lambda of the clause body into the head — a
  `function`'s scrutinee as the deterministic binder `lemTail` (name it
  in the measure: ``fuel_measure val f = `List.length lemTail + 1` ``), a
  user-written `fun k ->` under the user's name `k` (with or without a
  `function` beneath it), through the single-arm match lem's pattern
  compiler makes for a destructuring parameter — so the measure and the
  structural analysis see named parameters, and the generated `f` takes
  them as explicit arguments; the fuel sentinel, written at the head's
  original function-typed codomain, is applied to the hoisted binders.
  Refused if `lemTail` (or a hoisted user binder) would shadow a
  parameter or be captured, and if any constant the body references
  renders on Lean as a reserved synthesized name (`lemFuel`,
  `lemMeasureLe`, `LemFuel`, `lemTail`, `_lemReader_*`, `_lemSupply*` —
  a Lean `target_rep` spelled that way would be captured silently; the
  same check runs for every fuel'd/reader/supply definition). The OCaml
  output is untouched. An inductive relation whose premise
  reaches the fuel takes `[LemFuel]` as an inductive parameter.
  Cerberus applies fuel declares across its whole execution path and
  checks that slice is total in its own build.
- **Zero axioms; effects are explicit state.** The shipped runtime declares no axioms, and the backend adds no
  axiom declarations. A downstream proof still requires an axiom audit
  of its hand-written imports and target representations. Ambient counters are
  threaded as explicit state ("supply lifting": a definition marked
  ``declare {lean} supply val`` takes and returns the counter; draws
  are `LemLib.supplySplit`, a plain def), and ambient configuration
  is threaded as an explicit parameter ("reader lifting"). An earlier
  design had a library axiom (`declare {lean} effectful`) projecting
  `BaseIO` externs into pure types; it is gone, and the backend now
  rejects that annotation at generation time, naming supply lifting
  as the replacement (the note at the top of `lean-lib/LemLib.lean`
  records the change).
- **Derived instances are real and OCaml-compatible.** `BEq`/`Ord`
  are derived structurally per mutual block with OCaml polymorphic
  compare parity; `Inhabited` is derived fail-closed (bounded,
  per-constructor); instance priorities come from one normative
  table so resolution is deliberate, not declaration-order luck.
- **Unsupported forms are rejected, not approximated.** Set
  comprehensions with `IN`-bounded binders
  (`{ e | forall (e IN s) | P e }`) are macro-expanded to folds and
  compile like any other code; the forms that survive expansion — the
  unbounded `{ x | condition }`, and binder shapes the expansion
  cannot handle — are a generation-time error with rewrite
  suggestions, never a silent stub. The other unsupported corners
  follow the same pattern — see the negative suite in
  `tests/comprehensive/negative/`.

## Known limits

The parity suite at the measured pin has four registered expected failures:
`p_str_bytes` and `p_str_escapes` expose OCaml byte strings versus Lean
Unicode strings; `f_int_of_big_num` and `f_int32_overflow` record deliberate
numeric differences from the OCaml target. Failure tests compare reached
failures under `LEAN_ABORT_ON_PANIC=1`; unused pure failures can be erased.
Finite tests and local Pset/Pmap laws are not a general OCaml–Lean
correspondence theorem. The runtime translations retain their source
notices and license terms: [NOTICE](../../lean-lib/NOTICE.md).

Lem theorem/lemma statements are emitted as comments, not translated
proofs; Lem assertions become build-time evaluation checks.

General fuel-completion monotonicity and propagation are **not proved by
the backend** (TODO item 13). A per-function `fuel_measure` obligation
proves stability above the measure, optionally under a stated hypothesis;
it does not by itself prove that execution avoids the exhaustion result.
Default recursion remains `partial`. Reader seeding affects call sites
inside the seed definition; it cannot re-seed a closure built outside that
extent. Seed arguments are positional in globally sorted reader order;
same-typed swaps need value tests (see DESIGN).

## How you check it

- `cd tests/comprehensive && make lean` — generation over the test
  corpus, compilation of everything generated against LemLib, a
  pinned panic-path check (a reached panic aborts under
  `LEAN_ABORT_ON_PANIC=1`; the suite also checks default-return behavior without it), and a negative suite (programs the
  backend must *reject*, rejected for the declared reason).
- `cd lean-lib && ../scripts/capped lake build` — the runtime plus `LemLibTest.lean`
  (property tests for the set/map layers, including adversarial-key
  comparator coherence).
- `grep -rn "^axiom " lean-lib/ --include="*.lean"` — zero hits;
  `#print axioms` on any downstream theorem shows what its proof
  actually rests on.
- Downstream, cerberus-lean's differential lanes are this backend's
  largest consumer test.

## Status

The backend generates Cerberus’s selected Lean model and the comprehensive
suite. The consumer has a declared sequential execution profile, concurrency
stubs, native boundaries and explicit exclusions; this is not support for
every Cerberus model or C program. Known residual work, registered
in [TODO.md](TODO.md): emission uses a single module-scoped mutable
state (`St` in `src/lean_backend.ml`) with per-lifetime reset hooks —
effect-free emission is a planned refactor; the Ott grammar
in `language/lem.ott` carries the new declare forms, with
machine-checking pending Ott tooling. Upstreaming intent: every
extension is written to be plausibly acceptable to rems-project/lem
(no fork-only hacks in the core).
